My fin-\n\ngers stretch out, seeking Prim\u2019s warmth but finding only the \nrough canvas cover of the mattress. She must have had bad \ndreams and climbed in with our mother. Of course, she did. \nThis is the day of the reaping. \n\nI prop myself up on one elbow. There\u2019s enough light in the \nbedroom to see them. My little sister, Prim, curled up on her \nside, cocooned in my mother\u2019s body, their cheeks pressed to-\ngether. In sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not \nso beaten-down. Prim\u2019s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely \nas the primrose for which she was named. My mother was \nvery beautiful once, too. Or so they tell me. \n\nSitting at Prim\u2019s knees, guarding her, is the world\u2019s ugliest \ncat. Mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of \nrotting squash. Prim named him Buttercup, insisting that his \nmuddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. I le hates me. \nOr at least distrusts me. Even though it was years ago, I think \nhe still remembers how I tried to drown him in a bucket when \nPrim brought him home. Scrawny kitten, belly swollen with \nworms, crawling with fleas. The last thing I needed was \nanother mouth to feed. But Prim begged so hard, cried even, I \nhad to let him stay. It turned out okay. My mother got rid of \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nthe vermin and he\u2019s a born mouser. Even catches the occa-\nsional rat. Sometimes, when I clean a kill, I feed Buttercup the \nentrails. He has stopped hissing at me. \n\nEntrails. No hissing. This is the closest we will ever come to \nlove. \n\nI swing my legs off the bed and slide into my hunting boots. \nSupple leather that has molded to my feet. I pull on trousers, a \nshirt, tuck my long dark braid up into a cap, and grab my fo-\nrage bag. On the table, under a wooden bowl to protect it from \nhungry rats and cats alike, sits a perfect little goat cheese \nwrapped in basil leaves. Prim\u2019s gift to me on reaping day. I put \nthe cheese carefully in my pocket as I slip outside. \n\nOur part of District 12, nicknamed the Seam, is usually \ncrawling with coal miners heading out to the morning shift at \nthis hour. Men and women with hunched shoulders, swollen \nknuckles, many who have long since stopped trying to scrub \nthe coal dust out of their broken nails, the lines of their sun-\nken faces. But today the black cinder streets are empty. Shut-\nters on the squat gray houses are closed. The reaping isn\u2019t un-\ntil two. May as well sleep in. If you can. \n\nOur house is almost at the edge of the Seam. I only have to \npass a few gates to reach the scruffy field called the Meadow. \nSeparating the Meadow from the woods, in fact enclosing all \nof District 12, is a high chain-link fence topped with barbed-\nwire loops. In theory, it\u2019s supposed to be electrified twenty-\nfour hours a day as a deterrent to the predators that live in the \nwoods \u2014 packs of wild dogs, lone cougars, bears \u2014 that used \nto threaten our streets. But since we\u2019re lucky to get two or \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nthree hours of electricity in the evenings, it\u2019s usually safe to \ntouch. Even so, I always take a moment to listen carefully for \nthe hum that means the fence is live. Right now, it\u2019s silent as a \nstone. Concealed by a clump of bushes, I flatten out on my bel-\nly and slide under a two-foot stretch that\u2019s been loose for \nyears. There are several other weak spots in the fence, but this \none is so close to home I almost always enter the woods here. \n\nAs soon as I\u2019m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and sheath of \narrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has \nbeen successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. \nInside the woods they roam freely, and there are added con-\ncerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths \nto follow. But there\u2019s also food if you know how to find it. My \nfather knew and he taught me some before he was blown to \nbits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I \nwas eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for \nhim to run. \n\nEven though trespassing in the woods is illegal and poach-\ning carries the severest of penalties, more people would risk it \nif they had weapons. But most are not bold enough to venture \nout with just a knife. My bow is a rarity, crafted by my father \nalong with a few others that I keep well hidden in the woods, \ncarefully wrapped in waterproof covers. My father could have \nmade good money selling them, but if the officials found out \nhe would have been publicly executed for inciting a rebellion. \nMost of the Peacekeepers turn a blind eye to the few of us who \nhunt because they\u2019re as hungry for fresh meat as anybody is. \nIn fact, they\u2019re among our best customers. But the idea that \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nsomeone might be arming the Seam would never have been \nallowed. \n\nIn the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harv-\nest apples. But always in sight of the Meadow. Always close \nenough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. \n\u201cDistrict Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,\u201d I \nmutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, \neven in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might \noverhear you. \n\nWhen I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the \nthings I would blurt out about District 12, about the people \nwho rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the \nCapitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to \nmore trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my \nfeatures into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever \nread my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only \npolite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than \ntrades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make \nmost of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I \navoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food short-\nages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my \nwords and then where would we be? \n\nIn the woods waits the only person with whom I can be \nmyself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my \npace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge \noverlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from \nunwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there brings on a \nsmile. Gale says I never smile except in the woods. \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\u201cHey, Catnip,\u201d says Gale. My real name is Katniss, but when \nI first told him, I had barely whispered it. So he thought I\u2019d \nsaid Catnip. Then when this crazy lynx started following me \naround the woods looking for handouts, it became his official \nnickname for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he \nscared off game. I almost regretted it because he wasn\u2019t bad \ncompany. But I got a decent price for his pelt. \n\n\u201cLook what I shot,\u201d Gale holds up a loaf of bread with an ar-\nrow stuck in it, and I laugh. It\u2019s real bakery bread, not the flat, \ndense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my \nhands, pull out the arrow, and hold the puncture in the crust \nto my nose, inhaling the fragrance that makes my mouth flood \nwith saliva. Fine bread like this is for special occasions. \n\n\u201cMm, still warm,\u201d I say. He must have been at the bakery at \nthe crack of dawn to trade for it. \u201cWhat did it cost you?\u201d \n\n\u201cJust a squirrel. Think the old man was feeling sentimental \nthis morning,\u201d says Gale. \u201cEven wished me luck.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, we all feel a little closer today, don\u2019t we?\u201d I say, not \neven bothering to roll my eyes. \u201cPrim left us a cheese.\u201d I pull it \nout. \n\nHis expression brightens at the treat. \u201cThank you, Prim. \nWe\u2019ll have a real feast.\u201d Suddenly he falls into a Capitol accent \nas he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally upbeat woman who \narrives once a year to read out the names at the leaping. \u201cI al-\nmost forgot! Happy Hunger Games!\u201d He plucks a few black-\nberries from the bushes around us. \u201cAnd may the odds \u2014\u201d He \ntosses a berry in a high arc toward me. \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nI catch it in my mouth and break the delicate skin with my \nteeth. The sweet tartness explodes across my tongue. \u201c\u2014 be \never in your favor!\u201d I finish with equal verve. We have to joke \nabout it because the alternative is to be scared out of your \nwits. Besides, the Capitol accent is so affected, almost anything \nsounds funny in it. \n\nI watch as Gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. He \ncould be my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even \nhave the same gray eyes. But we\u2019re not related, at least not \nclosely. Most of the families who work the mines resemble \none another this way. \n\nThat\u2019s why my mother and Prim, with their light hair and \nblue eyes, always look out of place. They are. My mother\u2019s \nparents were part of the small merchant class that caters to \nofficials, Peacekeepers, and the occasional Seam customer. \nThey ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of District 12. \nSince almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our \nhealers. My father got to know my mother because on his \nhunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell \nthem to her shop to be brewed into remedies. She must have \nreally loved him to leave her home for the Seam. I try to re-\nmember that when all I can see is the woman who sat by, \nblank and unreachable, while her children turned to skin and \nbones. I try to forgive her for my father\u2019s sake. But to be hon-\nest, I\u2019m not the forgiving type. \n\nGale spreads the bread slices with the soft goat cheese, \ncarefully placing a basil leaf on each while I strip the bushes of \ntheir berries. We settle back in a nook in the rocks. From this \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nplace, we are invisible but have a clear view of the valley, \nwhich is teeming with summer life, greens to gather, roots to \ndig, fish iridescent in the sunlight. The day is glorious, with a \nblue sky and soft breeze. The food\u2019s wonderful, with the \ncheese seeping into the warm bread and the berries bursting \nin our mouths. Everything would be perfect if this really was a \nholiday, if all the day off meant was roaming the mountains \nwith Gale, hunting for tonight\u2019s supper. But instead we have to \nbe standing in the square at two o\u2019clock waiting for the names \nto be called out. \n\n\u201cWe could do it, you know,\u201d Gale says quietly. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cLeave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we \n\ncould make it,\u201d says Gale. \nI don\u2019t know how to respond. The idea is so preposterous. \n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have so many kids,\u201d he adds quickly. \nThey\u2019re not our kids, of course. But they might as well be. \n\nGale\u2019s two little brothers and a sister. Prim. And you may as \nwell throw in our mothers, too, because how would they live \nwithout us? Who would fill those mouths that are always ask-\ning for more? With both of us hunting daily, there are still \nnights when game has to be swapped for lard or shoelaces or \nwool, still nights when we go to bed with our stomachs growl-\ning. \n\n\u201cI never want to have kids,\u201d I say. \n\u201cI might. If I didn\u2019t live here,\u201d says Gale. \n\u201cBut you do,\u201d I say, irritated. \n\u201cForget it,\u201d he snaps back. \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nThe conversation feels all wrong. Leave? How could I leave \nPrim, who is the only person in the world I\u2019m certain I love? \nAnd Gale is devoted to his family. We can\u2019t leave, so why both-\ner talking about it? And even if we did . . . even if we did . . . \nwhere did this stuff about having kids come from? There\u2019s \nnever been anything romantic between Gale and me. When we \nmet, I was a skinny twelve-year-old, and although he was only \ntwo years older, he already looked like a man. It took a long \ntime for us to even become friends, to stop haggling over \nevery trade and begin helping each other out. \n\nBesides, if he wants kids, Gale won\u2019t have any trouble find-\ning a wife. He\u2019s good-looking, he\u2019s strong enough to handle the \nwork in the mines, and he can hunt. You can tell by the way \nthe girls whisper about him when he walks by in school that \nthey want him. It makes me jealous but not for the reason \npeople would think. Good hunting partners are hard to find. \n\n\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d I ask. We can hunt, fish, or gath-\ner. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s fish at the lake. We can leave our poles and gather in \nthe woods. Get something nice for tonight,\u201d he says. \n\nTonight. After the reaping, everyone is supposed to cele-\nbrate. And a lot of people do, out of relief that their children \nhave been spared for another year. But at least two families \nwill pull their shutters, lock their doors, and try to figure out \nhow they will survive the painful weeks to come. \n\nWe make out well. The predators ignore us on a day when \neasier, tastier prey abounds. By late morning, we have a dozen \nfish, a bag of greens and, best of all, a gallon of strawberries. I \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nfound the patch a few years ago, but Gale had the idea to \nstring mesh nets around it to keep out the animals. \n\nOn the way home, we swing by the Hob, the black market \nthat operates in an abandoned warehouse that once held coal. \nWhen they came up with a more efficient system that trans-\nported the coal directly from the mines to the trains, the Hob \ngradually took over the space. Most businesses are closed by \nthis time on reaping day, but the black market\u2019s still fairly \nbusy. We easily trade six of the fish for good bread, the other \ntwo for salt. Greasy Sae, the bony old woman who sells bowls \nof hot soup from a large kettle, takes half the greens off our \nhands in exchange for a couple of chunks of paraffin. We \nmight do a tad better elsewhere, but we make an effort to \nkeep on good terms with Greasy Sae. She\u2019s the only one who \ncan consistently be counted on to buy wild dog. We don\u2019t hunt \nthem on purpose, but if you\u2019re attacked and you take out a dog \nor two, well, meat is meat. \u201cOnce it\u2019s in the soup, I\u2019ll call it \nbeef,\u201d Greasy Sae says with a wink. No one in the Seam would \nturn up their nose at a good leg of wild dog, but the Peacekee-\npers who come to the Hob can afford to be a little choosier. \n\nWhen we finish our business at the market, we go to the \nback door of the mayor\u2019s house to sell half the strawberries, \nknowing he has a particular fondness for them and can afford \nour price. The mayor\u2019s daughter, Madge, opens the door. She\u2019s \nin my year at school. Being the mayor\u2019s daughter, you\u2019d expect \nher to be a snob, but she\u2019s all right. She just keeps to herself. \nLike me. Since neither of us really has a group of friends, we \nseem to end up together a lot at school. Eating lunch, sitting \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nnext to each other at assemblies, partnering for sports activi-\nties. We rarely talk, which suits us both just fine. \n\nToday her drab school outfit has been replaced by an ex-\npensive white dress, and her blonde hair is done up with a \npink ribbon. Reaping clothes. \n\n\u201cPretty dress,\u201d says Gale. \nMadge shoots him a look, trying to see if it\u2019s a genuine \n\ncompliment or if he\u2019s just being ironic. It is a pretty dress, but \nshe would never be wearing it ordinarily. She presses her lips \ntogether and then smiles. \u201cWell, if I end up going to the Capi-\ntol, I want to look nice, don\u2019t I?\u201d \n\nNow it\u2019s Gale\u2019s turn to be confused. Does she mean it? Or is \nshe messing with him? I\u2019m guessing the second. \n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be going to the Capitol,\u201d says Gale coolly. His \neyes land on a small, circular pin that adorns her dress. Real \ngold. Beautifully crafted. It could keep a family in bread for \nmonths. \u201cWhat can you have? Five entries? I had six when I \nwas just twelve years old.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not her fault,\u201d I say. \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. Just the way it is,\u201d says Gale. Madge\u2019s \n\nface has become closed off. She puts the money for the berries \nin my hand. \u201cGood luck, Katniss.\u201d \u201cYou, too,\u201d I say, and the \ndoor closes. \n\nWe walk toward the Seam in silence. I don\u2019t like that Gale \ntook a dig at Madge, but he\u2019s right, of course. The reaping sys-\ntem is unfair, with the poor getting the worst of it. You be-\ncome eligible for the reaping the day you turn twelve. That \nyear, your name is entered once. At thirteen, twice. And so on \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nand so on until you reach the age of eighteen, the final year of \neligibility, when your name goes into the pool seven times. \nThat\u2019s true for every citizen in all twelve districts in the entire \ncountry of Panem. \n\nBut here\u2019s the catch. Say you are poor and starving as we \nwere. You can opt to add your name more times in exchange \nfor tesserae. Each tessera is worth a meager year\u2019s supply of \ngrain and oil for one person. You may do this for each of your \nfamily members as well. So, at the age of twelve, I had my \nname entered four times. Once, because I had to, and three \ntimes for tesserae for grain and oil for myself, Prim, and my \nmother. In fact, every year I have needed to do this. And the \nentries are cumulative. So now, at the age of sixteen, my name \nwill be in the reaping twenty times. Gale, who is eighteen and \nhas been either helping or single-handedly feeding a family of \nfive for seven years, will have his name in forty-two times. \n\nYou can see why someone like Madge, who has never been \nat risk of needing a tessera, can set him off. The chance of her \nname being drawn is very slim compared to those of us who \nlive in the Seam. Not impossible, but slim. And even though \nthe rules were set up by the Capitol, not the districts, certainly \nnot Madge\u2019s family, it\u2019s hard not to resent those who don\u2019t \nhave to sign up for tesserae. \n\nGale knows his anger at Madge is misdirected. On other \ndays, deep in the woods, I\u2019ve listened to him rant about how \nthe tesserae are just another tool to cause misery in our dis-\ntrict. A way to plant hatred between the starving workers of \nthe Seam and those who can generally count on supper and \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nthereby ensure we will never trust one another. \u201cIt\u2019s to the \nCapitol\u2019s advantage to have us divided among ourselves,\u201d he \nmight say if there were no ears to hear but mine. If it wasn\u2019t \nreaping day. If a girl with a gold pin and no tesserae had not \nmade what I\u2019m sure she thought was a harmless comment. \n\nAs we walk, I glance over at Gale\u2019s face, still smoldering un-\nderneath his stony expression. His rages seem pointless to me, \nalthough I never say so. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t agree with him. I \ndo. But what good is yelling about the Capitol in the middle of \nthe woods? It doesn\u2019t change anything. It doesn\u2019t make things \nfair. It doesn\u2019t fill our stomachs. In fact, it scares off the nearby \ngame. I let him yell though. Better he does it in the woods than \nin the district. \n\nGale and I divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of \nloaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, pa-\nraffin, and a bit of money for each. \n\n\u201cSee you in the square,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWear something pretty,\u201d he says flatly. \nAt home, I find my mother and sister are ready to go. My \n\nmother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. Prim is \nin my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. It\u2019s a bit \nbig on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. Even so, \nshe\u2019s having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. \n\nA tub of warm water waits for me. I scrub off the dirt and \nsweat from the woods and even wash my hair. To my surprise, \nmy mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me. \nA soft blue thing with matching shoes. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m trying to get past rejecting offers \nof help from her. For a while, I was so angry, I wouldn\u2019t allow \nher to do anything for me. And this is something special. Her \nclothes from her past are very precious to her. \n\n\u201cOf course. Let\u2019s put your hair up, too,\u201d she says. I let her \ntowel-dry it and braid it up on my head. I can hardly recognize \nmyself in the cracked mirror that leans against the wall. \n\n\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d says Prim in a hushed voice. \n\u201cAnd nothing like myself,\u201d I say. I hug her, because I know \n\nthese next few hours will be terrible for her. Her first reaping. \nShe\u2019s about as safe as you can get, since she\u2019s only entered \nonce. I wouldn\u2019t let her take out any tesserae. But she\u2019s wor-\nried about me. That the unthinkable might happen. \n\nI protect Prim in every way I can, but I\u2019m powerless against \nthe reaping. The anguish I always feel when she\u2019s in pain wells \nup in my chest and threatens to register on my (ace. I notice \nher blouse has pulled out of her skirt in the back again and \nforce myself to stay calm. \u201cTuck your tail in, little duck,\u201d I say, \nsmoothing the blouse back in place. \n\nPrim giggles and gives me a small \u201cQuack.\u201d \n\u201cQuack yourself,\u201d I say with a light laugh. The kind only \n\nPrim can draw out of me. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat,\u201d I say and plant a \nquick kiss on the top of her head. \n\nThe fish and greens are already cooking in a stew, but that \nwill be for supper. We decide to save the strawberries and ba-\nkery bread for this evening\u2019s meal, to make it special we say. \nInstead we drink milk from Prim\u2019s goat, Lady, and eat the \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nrough bread made from the tessera grain, although no one has \nmuch appetite anyway. \n\nAt one o\u2019clock, we head for the square. Attendance is man-\ndatory unless you are on death\u2019s door. This evening, officials \nwill come around and check to see if this is the case. If not, \nyou\u2019ll be imprisoned. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad, really, that they hold the reaping in the square \n\u2014 one of the few places in District 12 that can be pleasant. \nThe square\u2019s surrounded by shops, and on public market days, \nespecially if there\u2019s good weather, it has a holiday feel to it. \nBut today, despite the bright banners hanging on the build-\nings, there\u2019s an air of grimness. The camera crews, perched \nlike buzzards on rooftops, only add to the effect. \n\nPeople file in silently and sign in. The reaping is a good op-\nportunity for the Capitol to keep tabs on the population as \nwell. Twelve- through eighteen-year-olds are herded into \nroped areas marked off by ages, the oldest in the front, the \nyoung ones, like Prim, toward the back. Family members line \nup around the perimeter, holding tightly to one another\u2019s \nhands. But there are others, too, who have no one they love at \nstake, or who no longer care, who slip among the crowd, tak-\ning bets on the two kids whose names will be drawn. Odds are \ngiven on their ages, whether they\u2019re Seam or merchant, if they \nwill break down and weep. Most refuse dealing with the rack-\neteers but carefully, carefully. These same people tend to be \ninformers, and who hasn\u2019t broken the law? I could be shot on \na daily basis for hunting, but the appetites of those in charge \nprotect me. Not everyone can claim the same. \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nAnyway, Gale and I agree that if we have to choose between \ndying of hunger and a bullet in the head, the bullet would be \nmuch quicker. \n\nThe space gets tighter, more claustrophobic as people ar-\nrive. The square\u2019s quite large, but not enough to hold District \n12\u2019s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are di-\nrected to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event \non screens as it\u2019s televised live by the state. \n\nI find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the Seam. \nWe all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the \ntemporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It \nholds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for \nthe boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the \ngirls\u2019 ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on \nthem in careful handwriting. \n\nTwo of the three chairs fill with Madge\u2019s father, Mayor Un-\ndersee, who\u2019s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District \n12\u2019s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, \npinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each oth-\ner and then look with concern at the empty seat. \n\nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to \nthe podium and begins to read. It\u2019s the same story every year. \nHe tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out \nof the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He \nlists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the en-\ncroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the \nbrutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was \nPanem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nbrought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the \nDark Days, the uprising of the districts against the Capitol. \nTwelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty \nof Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as \nour yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be re-\npeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. \n\nThe rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In punishment \nfor the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one \ngirl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-\nfour tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that \ncould hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wastel-\nand. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must \nfight to the death. The last tribute standing wins. \n\nTaking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one \nanother while we watch \u2014 this is the Capitol\u2019s way of remind-\ning us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we \nwould stand of surviving another rebellion. \n\nWhatever words they use, the real message is clear. \u201cLook \nhow we take your children and sacrifice them and there\u2019s \nnothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every \nlast one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.\u201d \n\nTo make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol re-\nquires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting \nevent pitting every district against the others. The last tribute \nalive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will \nbe showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, \nthe Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nand even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle star-\nvation. \n\n\u201cIt is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,\u201d in-\ntones the mayor. \n\nThen he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In seventy-\nfour years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. \nHaymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at \nthis moment appears hollering something unintelligible, stag-\ngers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He\u2019s drunk. \nVery. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he\u2019s \nconfused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she \nbarely manages to fend off. \n\nThe mayor looks distressed. Since all of this is being tele-\nvised, right now District 12 is the laughingstock of Panem, and \nhe knows it. He quickly tries to pull the attention back to the \nreaping by introducing Effie Trinket. \n\nBright and bubbly as ever, Effie Trinket trots to the podium \nand gives her signature, \u201cHappy Hunger Games! And may the \nodds be ever in your favor!\u201d Her pink hair must be a wig be-\ncause her curls have shifted slightly off-center since her en-\ncounter with Haymitch. She goes on a bit about what an honor \nit is to be here, although everyone knows she\u2019s just aching to \nget bumped up to a better district where they have proper vic-\ntors, not drunks who molest you in front of the entire nation. \n\nThrough the crowd, I spot Gale looking back at me with a \nghost of a smile. As reapings go, this one at least has a slight \nentertainment factor. But suddenly I am thinking of Gale and \nhis forty-two names in that big glass ball and how the odds \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nare not in his favor. Not compared to a lot of the boys. And \nmaybe he\u2019s thinking the same thing about me because his face \ndarkens and he turns away. \u201cBut there are still thousands of \nslips,\u201d I wish I could whisper to him. \n\nIt\u2019s time for the drawing. Effie Trinket says as she always \ndoes, \u201cLadies first!\u201d and crosses to the glass ball with the girls\u2019 \nnames. She reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and \npulls out a slip of paper. The crowd draws in a collective \nbreath and then you can hear a pin drop, and I\u2019m feeling nau-\nseous and so desperately hoping that it\u2019s not me, that it\u2019s not \nme, that it\u2019s not me. \n\nEffie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip \nof paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it\u2019s not \nme. \n\nIt\u2019s Primrose Everdeen. \n\n\n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n \n \n \nOne time, when I was in a blind in a tree, waiting motion-\n\nless for game to wander by, I dozed off and fell ten feet to the \nground, landing on my back. It was as if the impact had \nknocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and I lay there \nstruggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything. \n\nThat\u2019s how I feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, \nunable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around \nthe inside of my skull. Someone is gripping my arm, a boy \nfrom the Seam, and I think maybe I started to fall and he \ncaught me. \n\nThere must have been some mistake. This can\u2019t be hap-\npening. Prim was one slip of paper in thousands! Her chances \nof being chosen so remote that I\u2019d not even bothered to worry \nabout her. Hadn\u2019t I done everything? Taken the tesserae, re-\nfused to let her do the same? One slip. One slip in thousands. \nThe odds had been entirely in her favor. But it hadn\u2019t mat-\ntered. \n\nSomewhere far away, I can hear the crowd murmuring un-\nhappily as they always do when a twelve-year-old gets chosen \nbecause no one thinks this is fair. And then I see her, the blood \ndrained from her face, hands clenched in fists at her sides, \nwalking with stiff, small steps up toward the stage, passing \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nme, and I see the back of her blouse has become untucked and \nhangs out over her skirt. It\u2019s this detail, the untucked blouse \nforming a ducktail, that brings me back to myself. \n\n\u201cPrim!\u201d The strangled cry comes out of my throat, and my \nmuscles begin to move again. \u201cPrim!\u201d I don\u2019t need to shove \nthrough the crowd. The other kids make way immediately al-\nlowing me a straight path to the stage. I reach her just as she is \nabout to mount the steps. With one sweep of my arm, I push \nher behind me. \n\n\u201cI volunteer!\u201d I gasp. \u201cI volunteer as tribute!\u201d \nThere\u2019s some confusion on the stage. District 12 hasn\u2019t had \n\na volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty. The \nrule is that once a tribute\u2019s name has been pulled from the \nball, another eligible boy, if a boy\u2019s name has been read, or \ngirl, if a girl\u2019s name has been read, can step forward to take his \nor her place. In some districts, in which winning the reaping is \nsuch a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the vo-\nlunteering is complicated. But in District 12, where the word \ntribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse, vo-\nlunteers are all but extinct. \n\n\u201cLovely!\u201d says Effie Trinket. \u201cBut I believe there\u2019s a small \nmatter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for \nvolunteers, and if one does come forth then we, um . . .\u201d she \ntrails off, unsure herself. \n\n\u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d says the mayor. He\u2019s looking at me \nwith a pained expression on his face. He doesn\u2019t know me re-\nally, but there\u2019s a faint recognition there. I am the girl who \nbrings the strawberries. The girl his daughter might have spo-\n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nken of on occasion. The girl who five years ago stood huddled \nwith her mother and sister, as he presented her, the oldest \nchild, with a medal of valor. A medal for her father, vaporized \nin the mines. Does he remember that? \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201d \nhe repeats gruffly. \u201cLet her come forward.\u201d \n\nPrim is screaming hysterically behind me. She\u2019s wrapped \nher skinny arms around me like a vice. \u201cNo, Katniss! No! You \ncan\u2019t go!\u201d \n\n\u201cPrim, let go,\u201d I say harshly, because this is upsetting me \nand I don\u2019t want to cry. When they televise the replay of the \nreapings tonight, everyone will make note of my tears, and I\u2019ll \nbe marked as an easy target. A weakling. I will give no one \nthat satisfaction. \u201cLet go!\u201d \n\nI can feel someone pulling her from my back. I turn and see \nGale has lifted Prim off the ground and she\u2019s thrashing in his \narms. \u201cUp you go, Catnip,\u201d he says, in a voice he\u2019s fighting to \nkeep steady, and then he carries Prim off toward my mother. I \nsteel myself and climb the steps. \n\n\u201cWell, bravo!\u201d gushes Effie Trinket. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit of the \nGames!\u201d She\u2019s pleased to finally have a district with a little ac-\ntion going on in it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d \n\nI swallow hard. \u201cKatniss Everdeen,\u201d I say. \n\u201cI bet my buttons that was your sister. Don\u2019t want her to \n\nsteal all the glory, do we? Come on, everybody! Let\u2019s give a big \nround of applause to our newest tribute!\u201d trills Effie Trinket. \n\nTo the everlasting credit of the people of District 12, not \none person claps. Not even the ones holding betting slips, the \nones who are usually beyond caring. Possibly because they \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nknow me from the Hob, or knew my father, or have encoun-\ntered Prim, who no one can help loving. So instead of ac-\nknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they \ntake part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Si-\nlence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of \nthis is wrong. \n\nThen something unexpected happens. At least, I don\u2019t ex-\npect it because I don\u2019t think of District 12 as a place that cares \nabout me. But a shift has occurred since I stepped up to take \nPrim\u2019s place, and now it seems I have become someone pre-\ncious. At first one, then another, then almost every member of \nthe crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand \nto their lips and holds it out to me. It is an old and rarely used \ngesture of our district, occasionally seen at funerals. It means \nthanks, it means admiration, it means good-bye to someone \nyou love. \n\nNow I am truly in danger of crying, but fortunately Hay-\nmitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to \ncongratulate me. \u201cLook at her. Look at this one!\u201d he hollers, \nthrowing an arm around my shoulders. He\u2019s surprisingly \nstrong for such a wreck. \u201cI like her!\u201d His breath reeks of liquor \nand it\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s bathed. \u201cLots of . . . \u201c He \ncan\u2019t think of the word for a while. \u201cSpunk!\u201d he says trium-\nphantly. \u201cMore than you!\u201d he releases me and starts for the \nfront of the stage. \u201cMore than you!\u201d he shouts, pointing direct-\nly into a camera. \n\nIs he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might ac-\ntually be taunting the Capitol? I\u2019ll never know because just as \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nhe\u2019s opening his mouth to continue, Haymitch plummets off \nthe stage and knocks himself unconscious. \n\nHe\u2019s disgusting, but I\u2019m grateful. With every camera gleeful-\nly trained on him, I have just enough time to release the small, \nchoked sound in my throat and compose myself. I put my \nhands behind my back and stare into the distance. \n\nI can see the hills I climbed this morning with Gale. For a \nmoment, I yearn for something . . . the idea of us leaving the \ndistrict . . . making our way in the woods . . . but I know I was \nright about not running off. Because who else would have vo-\nlunteered for Prim? \n\nHaymitch is whisked away on a stretcher, and Effie Trinket \nis trying to get the ball rolling again. \u201cWhat an exciting day!\u201d \nshe warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig, which has \nlisted severely to the right. \u201cBut more excitement to come! It\u2019s \ntime to choose our boy tribute!\u201d Clearly hoping to contain her \ntenuous hair situation, she plants one hand on her head as she \ncrosses to the ball that contains the boys\u2019 names and grabs the \nfirst slip she encounters. She zips back to the podium, and I \ndon\u2019t even have time to wish for Gale\u2019s safety when she\u2019s read-\ning the name. \u201cPeeta Mellark.\u201d \n\nPeeta Mellark! \nOh, no, I think. Not him. Because I recognize this name, al-\n\nthough I have never spoken directly to its owner. Peeta Mel-\nlark. \n\nNo, the odds are not in my favor today. I watch him as he \nmakes his way toward the stage. Medium height, stocky build, \nashy blond hair that falls in waves over \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\nhis forehead. The shock of the moment is registering on his \nface, you can see his struggle to remain emotionless, but his \nblue eyes show the alarm I\u2019ve seen so often in prey. Yet he \nclimbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place. \n\nEffie Trinket asks for volunteers, but no one steps forward. \nHe has two older brothers, I know, I\u2019ve seen them in the ba-\nkery, but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the \nother won\u2019t. This is standard. Family devotion only goes so far \nfor most people on reaping day. What I did was the radical \nthing. \n\nThe mayor begins to read the long, dull Treaty of Treason \nas he does every year at this point \u2014 it\u2019s required \u2014 but I\u2019m \nnot listening to a word. \n\nWhy him? I think. Then I try to convince myself it doesn\u2019t \nmatter. Peeta Mellark and I are not friends. Not even neigh-\nbors. We don\u2019t speak. Our only real interaction happened \nyears ago. He\u2019s probably forgotten it. But I haven\u2019t and I know \nI never will. . . . \n\nIt was during the worst time. My father had been killed in \nthe mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest Janu-\nary anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had \npassed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling \nme over, racking my body with sobs. Where are you? I would \ncry out in my mind. Where have you gone? Of course, there \nwas never any answer. \n\nThe district had given us a small amount of money as com-\npensation for his death, enough to cover one month of griev-\ning at which time my mother would be expected to get a job. \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nOnly she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t do anything but sit propped up in a \nchair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, \neyes fixed on some point in the distance. Once in a while, she\u2019d \nstir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then \ncollapse back into stillness. No amount of pleading from Prim \nseemed to affect her. \n\nI was terrified. I suppose now that my mother was locked \nin some dark world of sadness, but at the time, all I knew was \nthat I had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. At ele-\nven years old, with Prim just seven, I took over as head of the \nfamily. There was no choice. I bought our food at the market \nand cooked it as best I could and tried to keep Prim and my-\nself looking presentable. Because if it had become known that \nmy mother could no longer care for us, the district would have \ntaken us away from her and placed us in the community \nhome. I\u2019d grown up seeing those home kids at school. The \nsadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hope-\nlessness that curled their shoulders forward. I could never let \nthat happen to Prim. Sweet, tiny Prim who cried when I cried \nbefore she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my \nmother\u2019s hair before we left for school, who still polished my \nfather\u2019s shaving mirror each night because he\u2019d hated the \nlayer of coal dust that settled on everything in the Seam. The \ncommunity home would crush her like a bug. So I kept our \npredicament a secret. \n\nBut the money ran out and we were slowly starving to \ndeath. There\u2019s no other way to put it. I kept telling myself if I \ncould only hold out until May, just May 8th, I would turn \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\ntwelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that \nprecious grain and oil to feed us. Only there were still several \nweeks to go. We could well be dead by then. \n\nStarvation\u2019s not an uncommon fate in District 12. Who \nhasn\u2019t seen the victims? Older people who can\u2019t work. Child-\nren from a family with too many to feed. Those injured in the \nmines. Straggling through the streets. And one day, you come \nupon them sitting motionless against a wall or lying in the \nMeadow, you hear the wails from a house, and the Peacekee-\npers are called in to retrieve the body. Starvation is never the \ncause of death officially. It\u2019s always the flu, or exposure, or \npneumonia. But that fools no one. \n\nOn the afternoon of my encounter with Peeta Mellark, the \nrain was falling in relentless icy sheets. I had been in town, \ntrying to trade some threadbare old baby clothes of Prim\u2019s in \nthe public market, but there were no takers. Although I had \nbeen to the Hob on several occasions with my father, I was too \nfrightened to venture into that rough, gritty place alone. The \nrain had soaked through my father\u2019s hunting jacket, leaving \nme chilled to the bone. For three days, we\u2019d had nothing but \nboiled water with some old dried mint leaves I\u2019d found in the \nback of a cupboard. By the time the market closed, I was shak-\ning so hard I dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud \npuddle. I didn\u2019t pick it up for fear I would keel over and be un-\nable to regain my feet. Besides, no one wanted those clothes. \n\nI couldn\u2019t go home. Because at home was my mother with \nher dead eyes and my little sister, with her hollow cheeks and \ncracked lips. I couldn\u2019t walk into that room with the smoky \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nfire from the damp branches I had scavenged at the edge of \nthe woods after the coal had run out, my bands empty of any \nhope. \n\nI found myself stumbling along a muddy lane behind the \nshops that serve the wealthiest townspeople. The merchants \nlive above their businesses, so I was essentially in their back-\nyards. I remember the outlines of garden beds not yet planted \nfor the spring, a goat or two in a pen, one sodden dog tied to a \npost, hunched defeated in the muck. \n\nAll forms of stealing are forbidden in District 12. Punisha-\nble by death. But it crossed my mind that there might be \nsomething in the trash bins, and those were fair game. Per-\nhaps a bone at the butcher\u2019s or rotted vegetables at the groc-\ner\u2019s, something no one but my family was desperate enough to \neat. Unfortunately, the bins had just been emptied. \n\nWhen I passed the baker\u2019s, the smell of fresh bread was so \noverwhelming I felt dizzy. The ovens were in the back, and a \ngolden glow spilled out the open kitchen door. I stood mesme-\nrized by the heat and the luscious scent until the rain inter-\nfered, running its icy fingers down my back, forcing me back \nto life. I lifted the lid to the baker\u2019s trash bin and found it spot-\nlessly, heartlessly bare. \n\nSuddenly a voice was screaming at me and I looked up to \nsee the baker\u2019s wife, telling me to move on and did I want her \nto call the Peacekeepers and how sick she was of having those \nbrats from the Seam pawing through her trash. The words \nwere ugly and I had no defense. As I carefully replaced the lid \nand backed away, I noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nout from behind his mother\u2019s back. I\u2019d seen him at school. He \nwas in my year, but I didn\u2019t know his name. He stuck with the \ntown kids, so how would I? His mother went back into the ba-\nkery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as I \nmade my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned \nagainst the far side of an old apple tree. The realization that \nI\u2019d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. My knees \nbuckled and I slid down the tree trunk to its roots. It was too \nmuch. I was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. Let them \n\ncall the Peacekeepers and take us to the community home, I \nthought. Or better yet, let me die right here in the rain. \n\nThere was a clatter in the bakery and I heard the woman \nscreaming again and the sound of a blow, and I vaguely won-\ndered what was going on. Feet sloshed toward me through the \nmud and I thought, It\u2019s her. She\u2019s coming to drive me away with \n\na stick. But it wasn\u2019t her. It was the boy. In his arms, he carried \ntwo large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire \nbecause the crusts were scorched black. \n\nHis mother was yelling, \u201cFeed it to the pig, you stupid crea-\nture! Why not? No one decent will buy burned bread!\u201d \n\nHe began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss \nthem into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the \nmother disappeared to help a customer. \n\nThe boy never even glanced my way, but I was watching \nhim. Because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood \nout on his cheekbone. What had she hit him with? \n\nMy parents never hit us. I couldn\u2019t even imagine it. The boy \ntook one look back to the bakery as if checking that the coast \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nwas clear, then, his attention back on the pig, he threw a loaf \nof bread in my direction. The second quickly followed, and he \nsloshed back to the bakery, closing the kitchen door tightly \nbehind him. \n\nI stared at the loaves in disbelief. They were fine, perfect \nreally, except for the burned areas. Did he mean for me to \nhave them? He must have. Because there they were at my feet. \nBefore anyone could witness what had happened I shoved the \nloaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly \nabout me, and walked swiftly away. The heat of the bread \nburned into my skin, but I clutched it tighter, clinging to life. \n\nBy the time I reached home, the loaves had cooled some-\nwhat, but the insides were still warm. When I dropped them \non the table, Prim\u2019s hands reached to tear off a chunk, but I \nmade her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and \npoured warm tea. I scraped off the black stuff and sliced the \nbread. We ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. It was good hearty \nbread, filled with raisins and nuts. \n\nI put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell \ninto a dreamless sleep. It didn\u2019t occur to me until the next \nmorning that the boy might have burned the bread on pur-\npose. Might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing \nit meant being punished, and then delivered them to me. But I \ndismissed this. It must have been an accident. Why would he \nhave done it? He didn\u2019t even know me. Still, just throwing me \nthe bread was an enormous kindness that would have surely \nresulted in a beating if discovered. 1 couldn\u2019t explain his ac-\ntions. \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nWe ate slices of bread for breakfast and headed to school. It \nwas as if spring had come overnight. Warm sweet air. Fluffy \nclouds. At school, I passed the boy in the hall, his cheek had \nswelled up and his eye had blackened. He was with his friends \nand didn\u2019t acknowledge me in any way. But as I collected Prim \nand started for home that afternoon, I found him staring at me \nfrom across the school yard. Our eyes met for only a second, \nthen he turned his head away. I dropped my gaze, embar-\nrassed, and that\u2019s when I saw it. The first dandelion of the \nyear. A bell went off in my head. I thought of the hours spent \nin the woods with my father and I knew how we were going to \nsurvive. \n\nTo this day, I can never shake the connection between this \nboy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the \ndandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more \nthan once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his \neyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe \nhim something, and I hate owing people. Maybe if I had \nthanked him at some point, I\u2019d be feeling less conflicted now. I \nthought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never \nseemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because we\u2019re \ngoing to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly \nhow am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow \nit just won\u2019t seem sincere if I\u2019m trying to slit his throat. \n\nThe mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and mo-\ntions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and \nwarm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nand gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring \nsqueeze. Maybe it\u2019s just a nervous spasm. \n\nWe turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of Panem \nplays. \n\nOh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds are \n\nsomeone else will kill him before I do. \n\nOf course, the odds have not been very dependable of late. \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. I \n\ndon\u2019t mean we\u2019re handcuffed or anything, but a group of \nPeacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice \nBuilding. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I\u2019ve \nnever seen that happen though. \n\nOnce inside, I\u2019m conducted to a room and left alone. It\u2019s the \nrichest place I\u2019ve ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a \nvelvet couch and chairs. I know velvet because my mother has \na dress with a collar made of the stuff. When I sit on the couch, \nI can\u2019t help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. It \nhelps to calm me as I try to prepare for the next hour. The \ntime allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved \nones. I cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puf-\nfy eyes and a red nose. Crying is not an option. There will be \nmore cameras at the train station. \n\nMy sister and my mother come first. I reach out to Prim \nand she climbs on my lap, her arms around my neck, head \non my shoulder, just like she did when she was a toddler. \nMy mother sits beside me and wraps her arms around us. \nFor a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them \nall the things they must remember to do, now that I will not be \nthere to do them for them. \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nPrim is not to take any tesserae. They can get by, if \nthey\u2019re careful, on selling Prim\u2019s goat milk and cheese and the \nsmall apothecary business my mother now runs for the people \nin the Seam. Gale will get her the herbs she doesn\u2019t grow her-\nself, but she must be very careful to describe them because \nhe\u2019s not as familiar with them as I am. He\u2019ll also bring them \ngame \u2014 he and I made a pact about this a year or so ago \u2014 \nand will probably not ask for compensation, but they should \nthank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine. \n\nI don\u2019t bother suggesting Prim learn to hunt. I tried to teach \nher a couple of times and it was disastrous. The woods terri-\nfied her, and whenever I shot something, she\u2019d get teary and \ntalk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home \nsoon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I con-\ncentrate on that. \n\nWhen I am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, \nand staying in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, \nhard. \u201cListen to me. Are you listening to me?\u201d She nods, \nalarmed by my intensity. She must know what\u2019s coming. \u201cYou \ncan\u2019t leave again,\u201d I say. \n\nMy mother\u2019s eyes find the floor. \u201cI know. I won\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t \nhelp what\u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, you have to help it this time. You can\u2019t clock out and \nleave Prim on her own. There\u2019s no me now to keep you both \nalive. It doesn\u2019t matter what happens. Whatever you see on \nthe screen. You have to promise me you\u2019ll fight through it!\u201d My \nvoice has risen to a shout. In it is all the anger, all the fear I felt \nat her abandonment. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nShe pulls her arm from my grasp, moved to anger herself \nnow. \u201cI was ill. I could have treated myself if I\u2019d had the medi-\ncine I have now.\u201d \n\nThat part about her being ill might be true. I\u2019ve seen her \nbring back people suffering from immobilizing sadness since. \nPerhaps it is a sickness, but it\u2019s one we can\u2019t afford. \n\n\u201cThen take it. And take care of her!\u201d I say. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right, Katniss,\u201d says Prim, clasping my face in her \n\nhands. \u201cBut you have to take care, too. You\u2019re so fast and \nbrave. Maybe you can win.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t win. Prim must know that in her heart. The competi-\ntion will be far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier dis-\ntricts, where winning is a huge honor, who\u2019ve been trained \ntheir whole lives for this. Boys who are two to three times my \nsize. Girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a \nknife. Oh, there\u2019ll be people like me, too. People to weed out \nbefore the real fun begins. \n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d I say, because I can hardly tell my mother to carry \non if I\u2019ve already given up myself. Besides, it isn\u2019t in my nature \nto go down without a fight, even when things seem insur-\nmountable. \u201cThen we\u2019d be rich as Haymitch.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if we\u2019re rich. I just want you to come home. \nYou will try, won\u2019t you? Really, really try?\u201d asks Prim. \n\n\u201cReally, really try. I swear it,\u201d I say. And I know, because of \nPrim, I\u2019ll have to. \n\nAnd then the Peacekeeper is at the door, signaling our time \nis up, and we\u2019re all hugging one another so hard it hurts and \nall I\u2019m saying is \u201cI love you. I love you both.\u201d And they\u2019re say-\n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\ning it back and then the Peacekeeper orders them out and the \ndoor closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows as if \nthis can block the whole thing out. \n\nSomeone else enters the room, and when I look up, I\u2019m sur-\nprised to see it\u2019s the baker, Peeta Mellark\u2019s father. I can\u2019t be-\nlieve he\u2019s come to visit me. After all, I\u2019ll be trying to kill his son \nsoon. But we do know each other a bit, and he knows Prim \neven better. When she sells her goat cheeses at the Hob, she \nputs two of them aside for him and he gives her a generous \namount of bread in return. We always wait to trade with him \nwhen his witch of a wife isn\u2019t around because he\u2019s so much \nnicer. I feel certain he would never have hit his son the way \nshe did over the burned bread. But why has he come to see \nme? \n\nThe baker sits awkwardly on the edge of one of the plush \nchairs. He\u2019s a big, broad-shouldered man with burn scars from \nyears at the ovens. He must have just said goodbye to his son. \n\nHe pulls a white paper package from his jacket pocket and \nholds it out to me. I open it and find cookies. These are a lux-\nury we can never afford. \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say. The baker\u2019s not a very talkative man in \nthe best of times, and today he has no words at all. \u201cI had \nsome of your bread this morning. My friend Gale gave you a \nsquirrel for it.\u201d He nods, as if remembering the squirrel. \u201cNot \nyour best trade,\u201d I say. He shrugs as if it couldn\u2019t possibly mat-\nter. \n\nThen I can\u2019t think of anything else, so we sit in silence until \na Peacemaker summons him. He rises and coughs to clear his \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nthroat. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on the little girl. Make sure she\u2019s eat-\ning.\u201d \n\nI feel some of the pressure in my chest lighten at his words. \nPeople deal with me, but they are genuinely fond of Prim. \nMaybe there will be enough fondness to keep her alive. \n\nMy next guest is also unexpected. Madge walks straight to \nme. She is not weepy or evasive, instead there\u2019s an urgency \nabout her tone that surprises me. \u201cThey let you wear one \nthing from your district in the arena. One thing to remind you \nof home. Will you wear this?\u201d She holds out the circular gold \npin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn\u2019t paid much attention \nto it before, but now I see it\u2019s a small bird in flight. \n\n\u201cYour pin?\u201d I say. Wearing a token from my district is about \nthe last thing on my mind. \n\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll put it on your dress, all right?\u201d Madge doesn\u2019t \nwait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my \ndress. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll wear it into the arena, Katniss?\u201d she \nasks. \u201cPromise?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say. Cookies. A pin. I\u2019m getting all kinds of gifts to-\nday. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she\u2019s \ngone and I\u2019m left thinking that maybe Madge really has been \nmy friend all along. \n\nFinally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic \nbetween us, but when he opens his arms I don\u2019t hesitate to go \ninto them. His body is familiar to me \u2014 the way it moves, the \nsmell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I \nknow from quiet moments on a hunt \u2014 but this is the first \ntime I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he says. \u201cGetting a knife should be pretty easy, but \nyou\u2019ve got to get your hands on a bow. That\u2019s your best \nchance.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t always have bows,\u201d I say, thinking of the year \nthere were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to \nbludgeon one another to death with. \n\n\u201cThen make one,\u201d says Gale. \u201cEven a weak bow is better \nthan no bow at all.\u201d \n\nI have tried copying my father\u2019s bows with poor results. It\u2019s \nnot that easy. Even he had to scrap his own work sometimes. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if there\u2019ll be wood,\u201d I say. Another year, \nthey tossed everybody into a landscape of nothing but bould-\ners and sand and scruffy bushes. I particularly hated that year. \nMany contestants were bitten by venomous snakes or went \ninsane from thirst. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s almost always some wood,\u201d Gale says. \u201cSince that \nyear half of them died of cold. Not much entertainment in \nthat.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s true. We spent one Hunger Games watching the players \nfreeze to death at night. You could hardly see them because \nthey were just huddled in balls and had no wood for fires or \ntorches or anything. It was considered very anti-climactic in \nthe Capitol, all those quiet, bloodless deaths. Since then, \nthere\u2019s usually been wood to make fires. \n\n\u201cYes, there\u2019s usually some,\u201d I say. \n\u201cKatniss, it\u2019s just hunting. You\u2019re the best hunter I know,\u201d \n\nsays Gale. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just hunting. They\u2019re armed. They think,\u201d I say. \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n\u201cSo do you. And you\u2019ve had more practice. Real practice,\u201d \nhe says. \u201cYou know how to kill.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot people,\u201d I say. \n\u201cHow different can it be, really?\u201d says Gale grimly. \nThe awful thing is that if I can forget they\u2019re people, it will \n\nbe no different at all. \nThe Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for more \n\ntime, but they\u2019re taking him away and I start to panic. \u201cDon\u2019t \nlet them starve!\u201d I cry out, clinging to his hand. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t! You know I won\u2019t! Katniss, remember I \u2014\u201d he \nsays, and they yank us apart and slam the door and I\u2019ll never \nknow what it was he wanted me to remember. \n\nIt\u2019s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train sta-\ntion. I\u2019ve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wa-\ngons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. \n\nI\u2019ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming with re-\nporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my \nface. But I\u2019ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of \nemotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the \ntelevision screen on the wall that\u2019s airing my arrival live and \nfeel gratified that I appear almost bored. \n\nPeeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been crying \nand interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover \nit up. I immediately wonder if this will be his strategy in the \nGames. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other \ntributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out \nfighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from \nDistrict 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\ncowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were \nonly a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill \nviciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems \nan odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he\u2019s a baker\u2019s son. \nAll those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread \ntrays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It \nwill take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to over-\nlook him. \n\nWe have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the \ntrain while the cameras gobble up our images, then we\u2019re al-\nlowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The \ntrain begins to move at once. \n\nThe speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I\u2019ve \nnever been on a train, as travel between the districts is for-\nbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that\u2019s \nmainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It\u2019s \none of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles \nper hour. Our journey to the Capitol will take less than a day. \n\nIn school, they tell us the Capitol was built in a place once \ncalled the Rockies. District 12 was in a region known is Appa-\nlachia. Even hundreds of years ago, they mined coal here. \nWhich is why our miners have to dig so deep. \n\nSomehow it all comes back to coal at school. Besides basic \nreading and math most of our instruction is coal-related. Ex-\ncept for the weekly lecture on the history of Panem. It\u2019s most-\nly a lot of blather about what we owe the Capitol. I know there \nmust be more than they\u2019re telling us, an actual account of \nwhat happened during the rebellion. But I don\u2019t spend much \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\ntime thinking about it. Whatever the truth is, I don\u2019t see how it \nwill help me get food on the table. \n\nThe tribute train is fancier than even the room in the Jus-\ntice Building. We are each given our own chambers that have \na bedroom, a dressing area, and a private bathroom with hot \nand cold running water. We don\u2019t have hot water at home, un-\nless we boil it. \n\nThere are drawers filled with fine clothes, and Effie Trinket \ntells me to do anything I want, wear anything I want, every-\nthing is at my disposal. Just be ready for supper in an hour. I \npeel off my mother\u2019s blue dress and take a hot shower. I\u2019ve \nnever had a shower before. It\u2019s like being in a summer rain, \nonly warmer. I dress in a dark green shirt and pants. \n\nAt the last minute, I remember Madge\u2019s little gold pin. For \nthe first time, I get a good look at it. It\u2019s as if someone fa-\nshioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around \nit. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips. I \nsuddenly recognize it. A mockingjay. \n\nThey\u2019re funny birds and something of a slap in the face to \nthe Capitol. During the rebellion, the Capitol bred a series of \ngenetically altered animals as weapons. The common term for \nthem was muttations, or sometimes mutts for short. One was a \nspecial bird called a jabberjay that had the ability to memorize \nand repeat whole human conversations. They were homing \nbirds, exclusively male, that were released into regions where \nthe Capitol\u2019s enemies were known to be hiding. After the birds \ngathered words, they\u2019d fly back to centers to be recorded. It \ntook people awhile to realize what was going on in the dis-\n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\ntricts, how private conversations were being transmitted. \nThen, of course, the rebels fed the Capitol endless lies, and the \njoke was on it. So the centers were shut down and the birds \nwere abandoned to die off in the wild. \n\nOnly they didn\u2019t die off. Instead, the jabberjays mated with \nfemale mockingbirds creating a whole new species that could \nreplicate both bird whistles and human melodies. They had \nlost the ability to enunciate words but could still mimic a \nrange of human vocal sounds, from a child\u2019s high-pitched \nwarble to a man\u2019s deep tones. And they could re-create songs. \nNot just a few notes, but whole songs with multiple verses, if \nyou had the patience to sing them and if they liked your voice. \n\nMy father was particularly fond of mockingjays. When we \nwent hunting, he would whistle or sing complicated songs to \nthem and, after a polite pause, they\u2019d always sing back. Not \neveryone is treated with such respect. But whenever my fa-\nther sang, all the birds in the area would fall silent and listen. \nHis voice was that beautiful, high and clear and so filled with \nlife it made you want to laugh and cry at the same time. I could \nnever bring myself to continue the practice after he was gone. \nStill, there\u2019s something comforting about the little bird. It\u2019s \nlike having a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fas-\nten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a \nbackground, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying \nthrough the trees. \n\nEffie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her \nthrough the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with \npolished paneled walls. There\u2019s a table where all the dishes \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n \n\nare highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the \nchair next to him empty. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Haymitch?\u201d asks Effie Trinket brightly. \n\u201cLast time I saw him, he said he was going to take a nap,\u201d \n\nsays Peeta. \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s been an exhausting day,\u201d says Effie Trinket. I \n\nthink she\u2019s relieved by Haymitch\u2019s absence, and who can \nblame her? \n\nThe supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green \nsalad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a \nchocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps re-\nminding us to save space because there\u2019s more to come. But \nI\u2019m stuffing myself because I\u2019ve never had food like this, so \ngood and so much, and because probably the best thing I can \ndo between now and the Games is put on a few pounds. \n\n\u201cAt least, you two have decent manners,\u201d says Effie as we\u2019re \nfinishing the main course. \u201cThe pair last year ate everything \nwith their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset \nmy digestion.\u201d \n\nThe pair last year were two kids from the Seam who\u2019d nev-\ner, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. And when \nthey did have food, table manners were surely the last thing \non their minds. Peeta\u2019s a baker\u2019s son. My mother taught Prim \nand I to eat properly, so yes, I can handle a fork and knife. But \nI hate Effie Trinket\u2019s comment so much I make a point of eat-\ning the rest of my meal with my fingers. Then I wipe my hands \non the tablecloth. This makes her purse her lips tightly to-\ngether. \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nNow that the meal\u2019s over, I\u2019m fighting to keep the food \ndown. I can see Peeta\u2019s looking a little green, too. Neither of \nour stomachs is used to such rich fare. But if I can hold down \nGreasy Sae\u2019s concoction of mice meat, pig entrails, and tree \nbark \u2014 a winter specialty \u2014 I\u2019m determined to hang on to \nthis. \n\nWe go to another compartment to watch the recap of the \nreapings across Panem. They try to stagger them throughout \nthe day so a person could conceivably watch the whole thing \nlive, but only people in the Capitol could really do that, since \nnone of them have to attend reapings themselves. \n\nOne by one, we see the other reapings, the names called, \n(the volunteers stepping forward or, more often, not. We ex-\namine the faces of the kids who will be our competition. A few \nstand out in my mind. A monstrous boy who lunges forward \nto volunteer from District 2. A fox-faced girl with sleek red \nhair from District 5. A boy with a crippled foot from District \n10. And most hauntingly, a twelve-year-old girl from District \n11. She has dark brown skin and eyes, but other than that, \nshe\u2019s very like Prim in size and demeanor. Only when she \nmounts the stage and they ask for volunteers, all you can hear \nis the wind whistling through the decrepit buildings around \nher. There\u2019s no one willing to take her place. \n\nLast of all, they show District 12. Prim being called, me \nrunning forward to volunteer. You can\u2019t miss the desperation \nin my voice as I shove Prim behind me, as if I\u2019m afraid no one \nwill hear and they\u2019ll take Prim away. But, of course, they do \nhear. I see Gale pulling her off me and watch myself mount the \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\nstage. The commentators are not sure what to say about the \ncrowd\u2019s refusal to applaud. The silent salute. One says that \nDistrict 12 has always been a bit backward but that local cus-\ntoms can be charming. As if on cue, Haymitch falls off the \nstage, and they groan comically. Peeta\u2019s name is drawn, and he \nquietly takes his place. We shake hands. They cut to the an-\nthem again, and the pro-gram ends. \n\nEffie Trinket is disgruntled about the state her wig was in. \n\u201cYour mentor has a lot to learn about presentation. A lot about \ntelevised behavior.\u201d \n\nPeeta unexpectedly laughs. \u201cHe was drunk,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cHe\u2019s drunk every year.\u201d \n\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d I add. I can\u2019t help smirking a little. Effie Trinket \nmakes it sound like Haymitch just has somewhat rough man-\nners that could be corrected with a few tips from her. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d hisses Effie Trinket. \u201cHow odd you two find it amus-\ning. You know your mentor is your lifeline to the world in \nthese Games. The one who advises you, lines up your spon-\nsors, and dictates the presentation of any gifts. Haymitch can \nwell be the difference between your life and your death!\u201d \n\nJust then, Haymitch staggers into the compartment. \u201cI miss \nsupper?\u201d he says in a slurred voice. Then he vomits all over \nthe expensive carpet and falls in the mess. \n\n\u201cSo laugh away!\u201d says Effie Trinket. She hops in her pointy \nshoes around the pool of vomit and flees the room. \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n \n \n \nFor a few moments, Peeta and I take in the scene of our \n\nmentor trying to rise out of the slippery vile stuff from his \nstomach. The reek of vomit and raw spirits almost brings my \ndinner up. We exchange a glance. Obviously Haymitch isn\u2019t \nmuch, but Effie Trinket is right about one thing, once we\u2019re in \nthe arena he\u2019s all we\u2019ve got. As if by some unspoken agree-\nment, Peeta and I each take one of Haymitch\u2019s arms and help \nhim to his feet. \n\n\u201cI tripped?\u201d Haymitch asks. \u201cSmells bad.\u201d He wipes his hand \non his nose, smearing his face with vomit. \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to your room,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cClean you up \na bit.\u201d \n\nWe half-lead half-carry Haymitch back to his compartment. \nSince we can\u2019t exactly set him down on the embroidered bed-\nspread, we haul him into the bathtub and turn the shower on \nhim. He hardly notices. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Peeta says to me. \u201cI\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d \nI can\u2019t help feeling a little grateful since the last thing I want \n\nto do is strip down Haymitch, wash the vomit out of his chest \nhair, and tuck him into bed. Possibly Peeta is trying to make a \ngood impression on him, to be his favorite once the Games be-\n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n \n\ngin. But judging by the state he\u2019s in, Haymitch will have no \nmemory of this tomorrow. \n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I say. \u201cI can send one of the Capitol people to \nhelp you.\u201d There\u2019s any number on the train. Cooking lor us. \nWaiting on us. Guarding us. Taking care of us is their job. \n\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want them,\u201d says Peeta. \nI nod and head to my own room. I understand how Peeta \n\nfeels. I can\u2019t stand the sight of the Capitol people myself. But \nmaking them deal with Haymitch might be a small form of re-\nvenge. So I\u2019m pondering the reason why he insists on taking \ncare of Haymitch and all of a sudden I think, It\u2019s because he\u2019s \n\nbeing kind. Just as he was kind to give me the bread. \n\nThe idea pulls me up short. A kind Peeta Mellark is far more \ndangerous to me than an unkind one. Kind people have a way \nof working their way inside me and rooting there. And I can\u2019t \nlet Peeta do this. Not where we\u2019re going. So I decide, from this \nmoment on, to have as little as possible to do with the baker\u2019s \nson. \n\nWhen I get back to my room, the train is pausing at a plat-\nform to refuel. I quickly open the window, toss the cookies \nPeeta\u2019s father gave me out of the train, and slam the glass \nshut. No more. No more of either of them. \n\nUnfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and \nbursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see \nthe image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it\u2019s \n\nenough. Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the \nschool yard years ago . . . \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n \n\nI had just turned away from Peeta Mellark\u2019s bruised face \nwhen I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn\u2019t lost. I \nplucked it carefully and hurried home. I grabbed a bucket and \nPrim\u2019s hand and headed to the Meadow and yes, it was dotted \nwith the golden-headed weeds. After we\u2019d harvested those, \nwe scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until \nwe\u2019d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and \nflowers. That night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad \nand the rest of the bakery bread. \n\n\u201cWhat else?\u201d Prim asked me. \u201cWhat other food can we \nfind?\u201d \n\n\u201cAll kinds of things,\u201d I promised her. \u201cI just have to remem-\nber them.\u201d \n\nMy mother had a book she\u2019d brought with her from the \napothecary shop. The pages were made of old parchment and \ncovered in ink drawings of plants. Neat handwritten blocks \ntold their names, where to gather them, when they came in \nbloom, their medical uses. But my father added other entries \nto the book. Plants for eating, not healing. Dandelions, poke-\nweed, wild onions, pines. Prim and I spent the rest of the night \nporing over those pages. \n\nThe next day, we were off school. For a while I hung around \nthe edges of the Meadow, but finally I worked up the courage \nto go under the fence. It was the first time I\u2019d been there \nalone, without my father\u2019s weapons to protect me. But I re-\ntrieved the small bow and arrows he\u2019d made me from a hol-\nlow tree. I probably didn\u2019t go more than twenty yards into the \nwoods that day. Most of the time, I perched up in the branches \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n \n\nof an old oak, hoping for game to come by. After several hours, \nI had the good luck to kill a rabbit. \n\nI\u2019d shot a few rabbits before, with my father\u2019s guidance. But \nthis I\u2019d done on my own. \n\nWe hadn\u2019t had meat in months. The sight of the rabbit \nseemed to stir something in my mother. She roused herself, \nskinned the carcass, and made a stew with the meat and some \nmore greens Prim had gathered. Then she acted confused and \nwent back to bed, but when the stew was done, we made her \neat a bowl. \n\nThe woods became our savior, and each day I went a bit \nfarther into its arms. It was slow-going at first, but I was de-\ntermined to feed us. I stole eggs from nests, caught fish in nets, \nsometimes managed to shoot a squirrel or rabbit for stew, and \ngathered the various plants that sprung up beneath my feet. \nPlants are tricky. Many are edible, but one false mouthful and \nyou\u2019re dead. I checked and double-checked the plants I har-\nvested with my father\u2019s pictures. I kept us alive. \n\nAny sign of danger, a distant howl, the inexplicable break of \na branch, sent me flying back to the fence at first. Then I began \nto risk climbing trees to escape the wild dogs that quickly got \nbored and moved on. Bears and cats lived deeper in, perhaps \ndisliking the sooty reek of our district. \n\nOn May 8th, I went to the Justice Building, signed up for my \ntesserae, and pulled home my first batch of grain and oil in \nPrim\u2019s toy wagon. On the eighth of every month, I was entitled \nto do the same. I couldn\u2019t stop hunting and gathering, of \ncourse. The grain was not enough to live on, and there were \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\nother things to buy, soap and milk and thread. What we didn\u2019t \nabsolutely have to eat, I began to trade at the Hob. It was \nfrightening to enter that place without my father at my side, \nbut people had respected him, and they accepted me. Game \nwas game after all, no matter who\u2019d shot it. I also sold at the \nback doors of the wealthier clients in town, trying to remem-\nber what my father had told me and learning a few new tricks \nas well. The butcher would buy my rabbits but not squirrels. \nThe baker enjoyed squirrel but would only trade for one if his \nwife wasn\u2019t around. The Head Peacekeeper loved wild turkey. \nThe mayor had a passion for strawberries. \n\nIn late summer, I was washing up in a pond when I noticed \nthe plants growing around me. Tall with leaves like arrow-\nheads. Blossoms with three white petals. I knelt down in the \nwater, my fingers digging into the soft mud, and I pulled up \nhandfuls of the roots. Small, bluish tubers that don\u2019t look like \nmuch but boiled or baked are as good as any potato. \u201cKatniss,\u201d \nI said aloud. It\u2019s the plant I was named for. And I heard my fa-\nther\u2019s voice joking, \u201cAs long as you can find yourself, you\u2019ll \nnever starve.\u201d I spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my \ntoes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. \nThat night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were \nall, for the first time in months, full. \n\nSlowly, my mother returned to us. She began to clean and \ncook and preserve some of the food I brought in for winter. \nPeople traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. One \nday, I heard her singing. \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\nPrim was thrilled to have her back, but I kept watching, \nwaiting for her to disappear on us again. I didn\u2019t trust her. And \nsome small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weak-\nness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. \nPrim forgave her, but I had taken a step back from my mother, \nput up a wall to protect myself from needing her, and nothing \nwas ever the same between us again. \n\nNow I was going to die without that ever being set right. I \n\nthought of how I had yelled at her today in the Justice Build-\ning. I had told her I loved her, too, though. So maybe it would \nall balance out. \n\nFor a while I stand staring out the train window, wishing I \ncould open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such \nhigh speed. In the distance, I see the lights of another district. \n7? 10? I don\u2019t know. I think about the people in their houses, \nsettling in for bed. I imagine my home, with its shutters drawn \ntight. What are they doing now, my mother and Prim? Were \nthey able to eat supper? The fish stew and the strawberries? \nOr did it lay untouched on their plates? Did they watch the re-\ncap of the day\u2019s events on the battered old TV that sits on the \ntable against the wall? Surely, there were more tears. Is my \nmother holding up, being strong for Prim? Or has she already \nstarted to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sis-\nter\u2019s fragile shoulders? \n\nPrim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. The \nthought of that scruffy old Buttercup posting himself on the \nbed to watch over Prim comforts me. If she cries, he will nose \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\nhis way into her arms and curl up there until she calms down \nand falls asleep. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t drown him. \n\nImagining my home makes me ache with loneliness. This \nday has been endless. Could Gale and I have been eating \nblackberries only this morning? It seems like a lifetime ago. \nLike a long dream that deteriorated into a nightmare. Maybe, \nif I go to sleep, I will wake up back in District 12, where I be-\nlong. \n\nProbably the drawers hold any number of nightgowns, but I \njust strip off my shirt and pants and climb into bed in my un-\nderwear. The sheets are made of soft, silky fabric. A thick fluf-\nfy comforter gives immediate warmth. \n\nIf I\u2019m going to cry, now is the time to do it. By morning, I\u2019ll \nbe able to wash the damage done by the tears from my face. \nBut no tears come. I\u2019m too tired or too numb to cry. The only \nthing I feel is a desire to be somewhere else. So I let the train \nrock me into oblivion. \n\nGray light is leaking through the curtains when the rapping \nrouses me. I hear Effie Trinket\u2019s voice, calling me to rise. \u201cUp, \nup, up! It\u2019s going to be a big, big, big day!\u201d I try and imagine, \nfor a moment, what it must be like inside that woman\u2019s head. \nWhat thoughts fill her waking hours? What dreams come to \nher at night? I have no idea. \n\nI put the green outfit back on since it\u2019s not really dirty, just \nslightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. My \nfingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and I \nthink of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and \nPrim waking up, having to get on with things. \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nI slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the \nreaping and it doesn\u2019t look too bad, so I just leave it up. It \ndoesn\u2019t matter. We can\u2019t be far from the Capitol now. And \nonce we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the \nopening ceremonies tonight anyway. I just hope I get one who \ndoesn\u2019t think nudity is the last word in fashion. \n\nAs I enter the dining car, Effie Trinket brushes by me with a \ncup of black coffee. She\u2019s muttering obscenities under her \nbreath. Haymitch, his face puffy and red from the previous \nday\u2019s indulgences, is chuckling. Peeta holds a roll and looks \nsomewhat embarrassed. \n\n\u201cSit down! Sit down!\u201d says Haymitch, waving me over. The \nmoment I slide into my chair I\u2019m served an enormous platter \nof food. Eggs, ham, piles of fried potatoes. A tureen of fruit sits \nin ice to keep it chilled. The basket of rolls they set before me \nwould keep my family going for a week. There\u2019s an elegant \nglass of orange juice. At least, I think it\u2019s orange juice. I\u2019ve only \neven tasted an orange once, at New Year\u2019s when my father \nbought one as a special treat. A cup of coffee. My mother \nadores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only \ntastes bitter and thin to me. A rich brown cup of something \nI\u2019ve never seen. \n\n\u201cThey call it hot chocolate,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cIt\u2019s good.\u201d \nI take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder \n\nruns through me. Even though the rest of the meal beckons, I \nignore it until I\u2019ve drained my cup. Then I stuff down every \nmouthful I can hold, which is a substantial amount, being care-\nful to not overdo it on the richest stuff. One time, my mother \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\ntold me that I always eat like I\u2019ll never see food again. And I \nsaid, \u201cI won\u2019t unless I bring it home.\u201d That shut her up. \n\nWhen my stomach feels like it\u2019s about to split open, I lean \nback and take in my breakfast companions. Peeta is still eat-\ning, breaking off bits of roll and dipping them in hot chocolate. \nHaymitch hasn\u2019t paid much attention to his platter, but he\u2019s \nknocking back a glass of red juice that he keeps thinning with \na clear liquid from a bottle. Judging by the fumes, it\u2019s some \nkind of spirit. I don\u2019t know Haymitch, but I\u2019ve seen him often \nenough in the Hob, tossing handfuls of money on the counter \nof the woman who sells white liquor. He\u2019ll be incoherent by \nthe time we reach the Capitol. \n\nI realize I detest Haymitch. No wonder the District 12 tri-\nbutes never stand a chance. It isn\u2019t just that we\u2019ve been un-\nderfed and lack training. Some of our tributes have still been \nstrong enough to make a go of it. But we rarely get sponsors \nand he\u2019s a big part of the reason why. The rich people who \nback tributes \u2014 either because they\u2019re betting on them or \nsimply for the bragging rights of picking a winner \u2014 expect \nsomeone classier than Haymitch to deal with. \n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re supposed to give us advice,\u201d I say to Haymitch. \n\u201cHere\u2019s some advice. Stay alive,\u201d says Haymitch, and then \n\nbursts out laughing. I exchange a look with Peeta before I re-\nmember I\u2019m having nothing more to do with him. I\u2019m sur-\nprised to see the hardness in his eyes. He generally seems so \nmild. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very funny,\u201d says Peeta. Suddenly he lashes out at \nthe glass in Haymitch\u2019s hand. It shatters on the floor, sending \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\nthe bloodred liquid running toward the back of the train. \u201cOn-\nly not to us.\u201d \n\nHaymitch considers this a moment, then punches Peeta in \nthe jaw, knocking him from his chair. When he turns back to \nreach for the spirits, I drive my knife into the table between \nhis hand and the bottle, barely missing his fingers. I brace my-\nself to deflect his hit, but it doesn\u2019t come. Instead he sits back \nand squints at us. \n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s this?\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cDid I actually get a pair \nof fighters this year?\u201d \n\nPeeta rises from the floor and scoops up a handful of ice \nfrom under the fruit tureen. He starts to raise it to the red \nmark on his jaw. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Haymitch, stopping him. \u201cLet the bruise show. \nThe audience will think you\u2019ve mixed it up with another tri-\nbute before you\u2019ve even made it to the arena.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s against the rules,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cOnly if they catch you. That bruise will say you fought, you \n\nweren\u2019t caught, even better,\u201d says Haymitch. He turns to me. \n\u201cCan you hit anything with that knife besides a table?\u201d \n\nThe bow and arrow is my weapon. But I\u2019ve spent a fair \namount of time throwing knives as well. Sometimes, if I\u2019ve \nwounded an animal with an arrow, it\u2019s better to get a knife in-\nto it, too, before I approach it. I realize that if I want Hay-\nmitch\u2019s attention, this is my moment to make an impression. I \nyank the knife out of the table, get a grip on the blade, and \nthen throw it into the wall across the room. I was actually just \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\nhoping to get a good solid stick, but it lodges in the seam be-\ntween two panels, making me look a lot better than I am. \n\n\u201cStand over here. Both of you,\u201d says Haymitch, nodding to \nthe middle of the room. We obey and he circles us, prodding \nus like animals at times, checking our muscles, examining our \nfaces. \u201cWell, you\u2019re not entirely hopeless. Seem fit. And once \nthe stylists get hold of you, you\u2019ll be attractive enough.\u201d \n\nPeeta and I don\u2019t question this. The Hunger Games aren\u2019t a \nbeauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to \npull more sponsors. \n\n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll make a deal with you. You don\u2019t interfere with \nmy drinking, and I\u2019ll stay sober enough to help you,\u201d says \nHaymitch. \u201cBut you have to do exactly what I say.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from \nten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. \n\n\u201cFine,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cSo help us,\u201d I say. \u201cWhen we get to the arena, what\u2019s the \n\nbest strategy at the Cornucopia for someone \u2014\u201d \n\u201cOne thing at a time. In a few minutes, we\u2019ll be pulling into \n\nthe station. You\u2019ll be put in the hands of your stylists. You\u2019re \nnot going to like what they do to you. But no matter what it is, \ndon\u2019t resist,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cBut \u2014\u201d I begin. \n\u201cNo buts. Don\u2019t resist,\u201d says Haymitch. He takes the bottle \n\nof spirits from the table and leaves the car. As the door swings \nshut behind him, the car goes dark. There are still a few lights \ninside, but outside it\u2019s as if night has fallen again. I realize we \nmust be in the tunnel that runs up through the mountains into \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n \n\nthe Capitol. The mountains form a natural barrier between the \nCapitol and the eastern districts. It is almost impossible to en-\nter from the east except through the tunnels. This geographi-\ncal advantage was a major factor in the districts losing the war \nthat led to my being a tribute today. Since the rebels had to \nscale the mountains, they were easy targets for the Capitol\u2019s \nair forces. \n\nPeeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds \nalong. The tunnel goes on and on and I think of the tons of \nrock separating me from the sky, and my chest tightens. I hate \nbeing encased in stone this way. It reminds me of the mines \nand my father, trapped, unable to reach sunlight, buried for-\never in the darkness. \n\nThe train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light \nfloods the compartment. We can\u2019t help it. Both Peeta and I run \nto the window to see what we\u2019ve only seen on television, the \nCapitol, the ruling city of Panem. The cameras haven\u2019t lied \nabout its grandeur. If anything, they have not quite captured \nthe magnificence of the glistening buildings in a rainbow of \nhues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll down the \nwide paved streets, the oddly dressed people with bizarre hair \nand painted faces who have never missed a meal. All the col-\nors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too bright, \nthe yellows painful to the eyes, like the flat round disks of \nhard candy we can never afford to buy at the tiny sweet shop \nin District 12. \n\nThe people begin to point at us eagerly as they recognize a \ntribute train rolling into the city. I step away from the win-\n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n \n\ndow, sickened by their excitement, knowing they can\u2019t wait to \nwatch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually waving and \nsmiling at the gawking crowd. He only stops when the train \npulls into the station, blocking us from their view. \n\nHe sees me staring at him and shrugs. \u201cWho knows?\u201d he \nsays. \u201cOne of them may be rich.\u201d \n\nI have misjudged him. I think of his actions since the reap-\ning began. The friendly squeeze of my hand. His father show-\ning up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim . . . did \nPeeta put him up to that? His tears at the station. Volunteering \nto wash Haymitch but then challenging him this morning \nwhen apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. And now \nthe waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd. \n\nAll of the pieces are still fitting together, but I sense he has \na plan forming. He hasn\u2019t accepted his death. He is already \nfighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta \nMellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is fighting hard to kill \nme.\n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n \n\n \n \n \nR-i-i-i-p! I grit my teeth as Venia, a woman with aqua hair \n\nand gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of Fabric \nfrom my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. \u201cSorry!\u201d she pipes \nin her silly Capitol accent. \u201cYou\u2019re just so hairy!\u201d \n\nWhy do these people speak in such a high pitch? Why do \ntheir jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the ends of \ntheir sentences go up as if they\u2019re asking a question? Odd vo-\nwels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter s . . . no \nwonder it\u2019s impossible not to mimic them. \n\nVenia makes what\u2019s supposed to be a sympathetic face. \n\u201cGood news, though. This is the last one. Ready?\u201d I get a grip \non the edges of the table I\u2019m seated on and nod. The final \nswathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk. \n\nI\u2019ve been in the Remake Center for more than three hours \nand I still haven\u2019t met my stylist. Apparently he has no interest \nin seeing me until Venia and the other members of my prep \nteam have addressed some obvious problems. This has in-\ncluded scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has \nremoved not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning \nmy nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body \nof hair. My legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eye-\nbrows have been stripped of the Muff, leaving me like a \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n \n\nplucked bird, ready for roasting. I don\u2019t like it. My skin feels \nsore and tingling and intensely vulnerable. But I have kept my \nside of the bargain with Haymitch, and no objection has \ncrossed my lips. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re doing very well,\u201d says some guy named Flavius. He \ngives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh \ncoat of purple lipstick to his mouth. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we \ncan\u2019t stand, it\u2019s a whiner. Grease her down!\u201d \n\nVenia and Octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has \nbeen dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lo-\ntion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. Then they \npull me from the table, removing the thin robe I\u2019ve been al-\nlowed to wear off and on. I stand there, completely naked, as \nthe three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits \nof hair. I know I should be embarrassed, but they\u2019re so unlike \npeople that I\u2019m no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly \ncolored birds were pecking around my feet. \n\nThe three step back and admire their work. \u201cExcellent! You \nalmost look like a human being now!\u201d says Flavius, and they \nall laugh. \n\nI force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful I am. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say sweetly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much cause to look \nnice in District Twelve.\u201d \n\nThis wins them over completely. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t, you \npoor darling!\u201d says Octavia clasping her hands together in dis-\ntress for me. \n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry,\u201d says Venia. \u201cBy the time Cinna is through \nwith you, you\u2019re going to be absolutely gorgeous!\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\n\u201cWe promise! You know, now that we\u2019ve gotten rid of all \nthe hair and filth, you\u2019re not horrible at all!\u201d says Flavius en-\ncouragingly. \u201cLet\u2019s call Cinna!\u201d \n\nThey dart out of the room. It\u2019s hard to hate my prep team. \nThey\u2019re such total idiots. And yet, in an odd way, I know \nthey\u2019re sincerely trying to help me. \n\nI look at the cold white walls and floor and resist the im-\npulse to retrieve my robe. But this Cinna, my stylist, will sure-\nly make me remove it at once. Instead my hands go to my \nhairdo, the one area of my body my prep team had been told \nto leave alone. My fingers stroke the silky braids my mother \nso carefully arranged. My mother. I left her blue dress and \nshoes on the floor of my train car, never thinking about re-\ntrieving them, of trying to hold on to a piece of her, of home. \nNow I wish I had. \n\nThe door opens and a young man who must be Cinna en-\nters. I\u2019m taken aback by how normal he looks. Most of the styl-\nists they interview on television are so dyed, stenciled, and \nsurgically altered they\u2019re grotesque. But Cinna\u2019s close-\ncropped hair appears to be its natural shade of brown. He\u2019s in \na simple black shirt and pants. The only concession to self-\nalteration seems to be metallic gold eyeliner that has been ap-\nplied with a light hand. It brings out the flecks of gold in his \ngreen eyes. And, despite my disgust with the Capitol and their \nhideous fashions, I can\u2019t help thinking how attractive it looks. \n\n\u201cHello, Katniss. I\u2019m Cinna, your stylist,\u201d he says in a quiet \nvoice somewhat lacking in the Capitol\u2019s affectations. \n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I venture cautiously. \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n \n\n\u201cJust give me a moment, all right?\u201d he asks. He walks \naround my naked body, not touching me, but taking in every \ninch of it with his eyes. I resist the impulse to cross my arms \nover my chest. \u201cWho did your hair?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy mother,\u201d I say. \n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. Classic really. And in almost perfect balance \n\nwith your profile. She has very clever fingers,\u201d he says. \nI had expected someone flamboyant, someone older trying \n\ndesperately to look young, someone who viewed me as a piece \nof meat to be prepared for a platter. Cinna has met none of \nthese expectations. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re new, aren\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you before,\u201d \nI say. Most of the stylists are familiar, constants in the ever-\nchanging pool of tributes. Some have been around my whole \nlife. \n\n\u201cYes, this is my first year in the Games,\u201d says Cinna. \n\u201cSo they gave you District Twelve,\u201d I say. Newcomers gen-\n\nerally end up with us, the least desirable district. \n\u201cI asked for District Twelve,\u201d he says without further ex-\n\nplanation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you put on your robe and we\u2019ll have a \nchat.\u201d \n\nPulling on my robe, I follow him through a door into a sit-\nting room. Two red couches face off over a low table. Three \nwalls are blank, the fourth is entirely glass, providing a win-\ndow to the city. I can see by the light that it must be around \nnoon, although the sunny sky has turned overcast. Cinna in-\nvites me to sit on one of the couches and takes his place across \nfrom me. He presses a button on the side of the table. The top \n\n\n\n \n\n65 \n \n\nsplits and from below rises a second tabletop that holds our \nlunch. Chicken and chunks of oranges cooked in a creamy \nsauce laid on a bed of pearly white grain, tiny green peas and \nonions, rolls shaped like flowers, and for dessert, a pudding \nthe color of honey. \n\nI try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home. \nChickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild \nturkey. I\u2019d need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an \norange. Goat\u2019s milk would have to substitute for cream. We \ncan grow peas in the garden. I\u2019d have to get wild onions from \nthe woods. I don\u2019t recognize the grain, our own tessera ration \ncooks down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would \nmean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three \nsquirrels. As for the pudding, I can\u2019t even guess what\u2019s in it. \nDays of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then \nit would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version. \n\nWhat must it be like, I wonder, to live in a world where \nfood appears at the press of a button? How would I spend the \nhours I now commit to combing the woods for sustenance if it \nwere so easy to come by? What do they do all day, these \npeople in the Capitol, besides decorating their bodies and \nwaiting around for a new shipment of tributes to roll in and \ndie for their entertainment? \n\nI look up and find Cinna\u2019s eyes trained on mine. \u201cHow des-\npicable we must seem to you,\u201d he says. \n\nHas he seen this in my face or somehow read my thoughts? \nHe\u2019s right, though. The whole rotten lot of them is despicable. \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n \n\n\u201cNo matter,\u201d says Cinna. \u201cSo, Katniss, about your costume \nfor the opening ceremonies. My partner, Portia, is the stylist \nfor your fellow tribute, Peeta. And our current thought is to \ndress you in complementary costumes,\u201d says Cinna. \u201cAs you \nknow, it\u2019s customary to reflect the flavor of the district.\u201d \n\nFor the opening ceremonies, you\u2019re supposed to wear \nsomething that suggests your district\u2019s principal industry. Dis-\ntrict 11, agriculture. District 4, fishing. District 3, factories. \nThis means that coming from District 12, Peeta and I will be in \nsome kind of coal miner\u2019s getup. Since the baggy miner\u2019s \njumpsuits are not particularly becoming, our tributes usually \nend up in skimpy outfits and hats with headlamps. One year, \nour tributes were stark naked and covered in black powder to \nrepresent coal dust. It\u2019s always dreadful and does nothing to \nwin favor with the crowd. I prepare myself for the worst. \n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll be in a coal miner outfit?\u201d I ask, hoping it won\u2019t be \nindecent. \n\n\u201cNot exactly. You see, Portia and I think that coal miner \nthing\u2019s very overdone. No one will remember you in that. And \nwe both see it as our job to make the District Twelve tributes \nunforgettable,\u201d says Cinna. \n\nI\u2019ll be naked for sure, I think. \n\u201cSo rather than focus on the coal mining itself, we\u2019re going \n\nto focus on the coal,\u201d says Cinna. Naked and covered in black \n\ndust, I think. \u201cAnd what do we do with coal? We burn it,\u201d says \nCinna. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not afraid of fire, are you, Katniss?\u201d He sees my ex-\npression and grins. \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n \n\nA few hours later, I am dressed in what will either be the \nmost sensational or the deadliest costume in the opening ce-\nremonies. I\u2019m in a simple black unitard that covers me from \nankle to neck. Shiny leather boots lace up to my knees. But it\u2019s \nthe fluttering cape made of streams of orange, yellow, and red \nand the matching headpiece that define this costume. Cinna \nplans to light them on fire just before our chariot rolls into the \nstreets. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not real flame, of course, just a little synthetic fire Por-\ntia and I came up with. You\u2019ll be perfectly safe,\u201d he says. But \nI\u2019m not convinced I won\u2019t be perfectly barbecued by the time \nwe reach the city\u2019s center. \n\nMy face is relatively clear of makeup, just a bit of highlight-\ning here and there. My hair has been brushed out and then \nbraided down my back in my usual style. \u201cI want the audience \nto recognize you when you\u2019re in the arena,\u201d says Cinna drea-\nmily. \u201cKatniss, the girl who was on fire.\u201d \n\nIt crosses my mind that Cinna\u2019s calm and normal demeanor \nmasks a complete madman. \n\nDespite this morning\u2019s revelation about Peeta\u2019s character, \nI\u2019m actually relieved when he shows up, dressed in an identic-\nal costume. He should know about fire, being a baker\u2019s son \nand all. His stylist, Portia, and her team accompany him in, \nand everyone is absolutely giddy with excitement over what a \nsplash we\u2019ll make. Except Cinna. He just seems a bit weary as \nhe accepts congratulations. \n\nWe\u2019re whisked down to the bottom level of the Remake \nCenter, which is essentially a gigantic stable. The opening ce-\n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n \n\nremonies are about to start. Pairs of tributes are being loaded \ninto chariots pulled by teams of four horses. Ours are coal \nblack. The animals are so well trained, no one even needs to \nguide their reins. Cinna and Portia direct us into the chariot \nand carefully arrange our body positions, the drape of our \ncapes, before moving off to consult with each other. \n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I whisper to Peeta. \u201cAbout the fire?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll rip off your cape if you\u2019ll rip off mine,\u201d he says through \n\ngritted teeth. \n\u201cDeal,\u201d I say. Maybe, if we can get them off soon enough, \n\nwe\u2019ll avoid the worst burns. It\u2019s bad though. They\u2019ll throw us \ninto the arena no matter what condition we\u2019re in. \u201cI know we \npromised Haymitch we\u2019d do exactly what they said, but I don\u2019t \nthink he considered this angle.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhere is Haymitch, anyway? Isn\u2019t he supposed to protect \nus from this sort of thing?\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cWith all that alcohol in him, it\u2019s probably not advisable to \nhave him around an open flame,\u201d I say. \n\nAnd suddenly we\u2019re both laughing. I guess we\u2019re both so \nnervous about the Games and more pressingly, petrified of be-\ning turned into human torches, we\u2019re not acting sensibly. \n\nThe opening music begins. It\u2019s easy to hear, blasted around \nthe Capitol. Massive doors slide open revealing the crowd-\nlined streets. The ride lasts about twenty minutes and ends up \nat the City Circle, where they will welcome us, play the an-\nthem, and escort us into the Training Center, which will be our \nhome/prison until the Games begin. \n\n\n\n \n\n69 \n \n\nThe tributes from District 1 ride out in a chariot pulled by \nsnow-white horses. They look so beautiful, spray-painted sil-\nver, in tasteful tunics glittering with jewels. District 1 makes \nluxury items for the Capitol. You can hear the roar of the \ncrowd. They are always favorites. \n\nDistrict 2 gets into position to follow them. In no time at all, \nwe are approaching the door and I can see that between the \novercast sky and evening hour the light is turning gray. The \ntributes from District 11 are just rolling out when Cinna ap-\npears with a lighted torch. \u201cHere we go then,\u201d he says, and be-\nfore we can react he sets our capes on fire. I gasp, waiting for \nthe heat, but there is only a faint tickling sensation. Cinna \nclimbs up before us and ignites our headdresses. He lets out a \nsign of relief. \u201cIt works.\u201d Then he gently tucks a hand under \nmy chin. \u201cRemember, heads high. Smiles. They\u2019re going to love \nyou!\u201d \n\nCinna jumps off the chariot and has one last idea. He shouts \nsomething up at us, but the music drowns him out. He shouts \nagain and gestures. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he saying?\u201d I ask Peeta. For the first time, I look at \nhim and realize that ablaze with the fake flames, he is daz-\nzling. And I must be, too. \n\n\u201cI think he said for us to hold hands,\u201d says Peeta. He grabs \nmy right hand in his left, and we look to Cinna for confirma-\ntion. He nods and gives a thumbs-up, and that\u2019s the last thing I \nsee before we enter the city. \n\nThe crowd\u2019s initial alarm at our appearance quickly \nchanges to cheers and shouts of \u201cDistrict Twelve!\u201d Every head \n\n\n\n \n\n70 \n \n\nis turned our way, pulling the focus from the three chariots \nahead of us. At first, I\u2019m frozen, but then I catch sight of us on \na large television screen and am floored by how breathtaking \nwe look. In the deepening twilight, the firelight illuminates \nour faces. We seem to be leaving a trail of fire off the flowing \ncapes. Cinna was right about the minimal makeup, we both \nlook more attractive but utterly recognizable. \n\nRemember, heads high. Smiles. They\u2019re going to love you! I \nhear Cinna\u2019s voice in my head. I lift my chin a bit higher, put \non my most winning smile, and wave with my free hand. I\u2019m \nglad now I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady, \nsolid as a rock. As I gain confidence, I actually blow a few \nkisses to the crowd. The people of the Capitol are going nuts, \nshowering us with flowers, shouting our names, our first \nnames, which they have bothered to find on the program. \n\nThe pounding music, the cheers, the admiration work their \nway into my blood, and I can\u2019t suppress my excitement. Cinna \nhas given me a great advantage. No one will forget me. Not my \nlook, not my name. Katniss. The girl who was on fire. \n\nFor the first time, I feel a flicker of hope rising up in me. \nSurely, there must be one sponsor willing to take me on! And \nwith a little extra help, some food, the right weapon, why \nshould I count myself out of the Games? \n\nSomeone throws me a red rose. I catch it, give it a delicate \nsniff, and blow a kiss back in the general direction of the giver. \nA hundred hands reach up to catch my kiss, as if it were a real \nand tangible thing. \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n \n\n\u201cKatniss! Katniss!\u201d I can hear my name being called from all \nsides. Everyone wants my kisses. \n\nIt\u2019s not until we enter the City Circle that I realize I must \nhave completely stopped the circulation in Peeta\u2019s hand. \nThat\u2019s how tightly I\u2019ve been holding it. I look down at our \nlinked fingers as I loosen my grasp, but he regains his grip on \nme. \u201cNo, don\u2019t let go of me,\u201d he says. The firelight flickers off \nhis blue eyes. \u201cPlease. I might fall out of this thing.\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. So I keep holding on, but I can\u2019t help feeling \nstrange about the way Cinna has linked us together. It\u2019s not \nreally fair to present us as a team and then lock us into the \narena to kill each other. \n\nThe twelve chariots fill the loop of the City Circle. On the \nbuildings that surround the Circle, every window is packed \nwith the most prestigious citizens of the Capitol. Our horses \npull our chariot right up to President Snow\u2019s mansion, and we \ncome to a halt. The music ends with a flourish. \n\nThe president, a small, thin man with paper-white hair, \ngives the official welcome from a balcony above us. It is tradi-\ntional to cut away to the faces of the tributes during the \nspeech. But I can see on the screen that we are getting way \nmore than our share of airtime. The darker it becomes, the \nmore difficult it is to take your eyes off our flickering. When \nthe national anthem plays, they do make an effort to do a \nquick cut around to each pair of tributes, but the camera holds \non the District 12 chariot as it parades around the circle one \nfinal time and disappears into the Training Center. \n\n\n\n \n\n72 \n \n\nThe doors have only just shut behind us when we\u2019re en-\ngulfed by the prep teams, who are nearly unintelligible as they \nbabble out praise. As I glance around, I notice a lot of the other \ntributes are shooting us dirty looks, which confirms what I\u2019ve \nsuspected, we\u2019ve literally outshone them all. Then Cinna and \nPortia are there, helping us down from the chariot, carefully \nremoving our flaming capes and headdresses. Portia extin-\nguishes them with some kind of spray from a canister. \n\nI realize I\u2019m still glued to Peeta and force my stiff fingers to \nopen. We both massage our hands. \n\n\u201cThanks for keeping hold of me. I was getting a little shaky \nthere,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t show,\u201d I tell him. \u201cI\u2019m sure no one noticed.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t notice anything but you. You should \n\nwear flames more often,\u201d he says. \u201cThey suit you.\u201d And then he \ngives me a smile that seems so genuinely sweet with just the \nright touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes \nthrough me. \n\nA warning bell goes off in my head. Don\u2019t be so stupid. Peeta \n\nis planning how to kill you, I remind myself. He is luring you in \n\nto make you easy prey. The more likable he is, the more deadly \n\nhe is. \n\nBut because two can play at this game, I stand on tiptoe and \nkiss his cheek. Right on his bruise. \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe Training Center has a tower designed exclusively for \n\nthe tributes and their teams. This will be our home until the \nactual Games begin. Each district has an entire floor. You \nsimply step onto an elevator and press the number of your \ndistrict. Easy enough to remember. \n\nI\u2019ve ridden the elevator a couple of times in the Justice \nBuilding back in District 12. Once to receive the medal for my \nfather\u2019s death and then yesterday to say my final goodbyes to \nmy friends and family. But that\u2019s a dark and creaky thing that \nmoves like a snail and smells of sour milk. The walls of this \nelevator are made of crystal so that you can watch the people \non the ground floor shrink to ants as you shoot up into the air. \nIt\u2019s exhilarating and I\u2019m tempted to ask Effie Trinket if we can \nride it again, but somehow that seems childish. \n\nApparently, Effie Trinket\u2019s duties did not conclude at the \nstation. She and Haymitch will be overseeing us right into the \narena. In a way, that\u2019s a plus because at least she can be \ncounted on to corral us around to places on time whereas we \nhaven\u2019t seen Haymitch since he agreed to help us on the train. \nProbably passed out somewhere. Effie Trinket, on the other \nhand, seems to be flying high. We\u2019re the first team she\u2019s ever \nchaperoned that made a splash at the opening ceremonies. \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n \n\nShe\u2019s complimentary about not just our costumes but how we \nconducted ourselves. And, to hear her tell it, Effie knows eve-\nryone who\u2019s anyone in the Capitol and has been talking us up \nall day, trying to win us sponsors. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very mysterious, though,\u201d she says, her eyes \nsquint half shut. \u201cBecause, of course, Haymitch hasn\u2019t bo-\nthered to tell me your strategies. But I\u2019ve done my best with \nwhat I had to work with. How Katniss sacrificed herself for \nher sister. How you\u2019ve both successfully struggled to over-\ncome the barbarism of your district.\u201d \n\nBarbarism? That\u2019s ironic coming from a woman helping to \nprepare us for slaughter. And what\u2019s she basing our success \non? Our table manners? \n\n\u201cEveryone has their reservations, naturally. You being from \nthe coal district. But I said, and this was very clever of me, I \nsaid, \u2018Well, if you put enough pressure on coal it turns to \npearls!\u2019\u201c Effie beams at us so brilliantly that we have no choice \nbut to respond enthusiastically to her cleverness even though \nit\u2019s wrong. \n\nCoal doesn\u2019t turn to pearls. They grow in shellfish. Possibly \nshe meant coal turns to diamonds, but that\u2019s untrue, too. I\u2019ve \nheard they have some sort of machine in District 1 that can \nturn graphite into diamonds. But we don\u2019t mine graphite in \nDistrict 12. That was part of District 13\u2019s job until they were \ndestroyed. \n\nI wonder if the people she\u2019s been plugging us to all day ei-\nther know or care. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n \n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t seal the sponsor deals for you. Only \nHaymitch can do that,\u201d says Effie grimly. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll \nget him to the table at gunpoint if necessary.\u201d \n\nAlthough lacking in many departments, Effie Trinket has a \ncertain determination I have to admire. \n\nMy quarters are larger than our entire house back home. \nThey are plush, like the train car, but also have so many auto-\nmatic gadgets that I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t have time to press all the \nbuttons. The shower alone has a panel with more than a hun-\ndred options you can choose regulating water temperature, \npressure, soaps, shampoos, scents, oils, and massaging \nsponges. When you step out on a mat, heaters come on that \nblow-dry your body. Instead of struggling with the knots in \nmy wet hair, I merely place my hand on a box that sends a \ncurrent through my scalp, untangling, parting, and drying my \nhair almost instantly. It floats down around my shoulders in a \nglossy curtain. \n\nI program the closet for an outfit to my taste. The windows \nzoom in and out on parts of the city at my command. You need \nonly whisper a type of food from a gigantic menu into a \nmouthpiece and it appears, hot and steamy, before you in less \nthan a minute. I walk around the room eating goose liver and \npuffy bread until there\u2019s a knock on the door. Effie\u2019s calling me \nto dinner. \n\nGood. I\u2019m starving. \nPeeta, Cinna, and Portia are standing out on a balcony that \n\noverlooks the Capitol when we enter the dining room. I\u2019m glad \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n \n\nto see the stylists, particularly after I hear that Haymitch will \nbe joining us. A meal presided over by just \n\nEffie and Haymitch is bound to be a disaster. Besides, din-\nner isn\u2019t really about food, it\u2019s about planning out our strate-\ngies, and Cinna and Portia have already proven how valuable \nthey are. \n\nA silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all \nstemmed glasses of wine. I think about turning it down, but \nI\u2019ve never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother \nuses for coughs, and when will I get a chance to try it again? I \ntake a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be \nimproved by a few spoonfuls of honey. \n\nHaymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. It looks \nas if he\u2019s had his own stylist because he\u2019s clean and groomed \nand about as sober as I\u2019ve ever seen him. He doesn\u2019t refuse the \noffer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, I realize it\u2019s \nthe first time I\u2019ve ever seen him eat. Maybe he really will pull \nhimself together long enough to help us. \n\nCinna and Portia seem to have a civilizing effect on Hay-\nmitch and Effie. At least they\u2019re addressing each other decent-\nly. And they both have nothing but praise for our stylists\u2019 \nopening act. While they make small talk, I concentrate on the \nmeal. Mushroom soup, bitter greens with tomatoes the size of \npeas, rare roast beef sliced as thin as paper, noodles in a green \nsauce, cheese that melts on your tongue served with sweet \nblue grapes. The servers, all young people dressed in white \ntunics like the one who gave us wine, move wordlessly to and \nfrom the table, keeping the platters and glasses full. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n \n\nAbout halfway through my glass of wine, my head starts \nfeeling foggy, so I change to water instead. I don\u2019t like the feel-\ning and hope it wears off soon. How Haymitch can stand walk-\ning around like this full-time is a mystery. \n\nI try to focus on the talk, which has turned to our interview \ncostumes, when a girl sets a gorgeous-looking cake on the ta-\nble and deftly lights it. It blazes up and then the flames flicker \naround the edges awhile until it finally goes out. I have a mo-\nment of doubt. \u201cWhat makes it burn? Is it alcohol?\u201d I say, look-\ning up at the girl. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing I wa \u2014 oh! I know \nyou!\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t place a name or time to the girl\u2019s face. But I\u2019m certain \nof it. The dark red hair, the striking features, the porcelain \nwhite skin. But even as I utter the words, I feel my insides con-\ntracting with anxiety and guilt at the sight of her, and while I \ncan\u2019t pull it up, I know some bad memory is associated with \nher. The expression of terror that crosses her face only adds \nto my confusion and unease. She shakes her head in denial \nquickly and hurries away from the table. \n\nWhen I look back, the four adults are watching me like \nhawks. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Katniss. How could you possibly know \nan Avox?\u201d snaps Effie. \u201cThe very thought.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s an Avox?\u201d I ask stupidly. \n\u201cSomeone who committed a crime. They cut her tongue so \n\nshe can\u2019t speak,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cShe\u2019s probably a traitor of \nsome sort. Not likely you\u2019d know her.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n \n\n\u201cAnd even if you did, you\u2019re not to speak to one of them un-\nless it\u2019s to give an order,\u201d says Effie. \u201cOf course, you don\u2019t real-\nly know her.\u201d \n\nBut I do know her. And now that Haymitch has mentioned \nthe word traitor I remember from where. The disapproval is \nso high I could never admit it. \u201cNo, I guess not, I just \u2014\u201d I \nstammer, and the wine is not helping. \n\nPeeta snaps his fingers. \u201cDelly Cartwright. That\u2019s who it is. I \nkept thinking she looked familiar as well. Then I realized she\u2019s \na dead ringer for Delly.\u201d \n\nDelly Cartwright is a pasty-faced, lumpy girl with yellowish \nhair who looks about as much like our server as a beetle does \na butterfly. She may also be the friendliest person on the pla-\nnet \u2014 she smiles constantly at everybody in school, even me. I \nhave never seen the girl with the red hair smile. But I jump on \nPeeta\u2019s suggestion gratefully. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s who I was \nthinking of. It must be the hair,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cSomething about the eyes, too,\u201d says Peeta. \nThe energy at the table relaxes. \u201cOh, well. If that\u2019s all it is,\u201d \n\nsays Cinna. \u201cAnd yes, the cake has spirits, but all the alcohol \nhas burned off. I ordered it specially in honor of your fiery de-\nbut.\u201d \n\nWe eat the cake and move into a sitting room to watch the \nreplay of the opening ceremonies that\u2019s being broadcast. A \nfew of the other couples make a nice impression, but none of \nthem can hold a candle to us. Even our own party lets out an \n\u201cAhh!\u201d as they show us coming out of the Remake Center. \n\n\u201cWhose idea was the hand holding?\u201d asks Haymitch. \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n \n\n\u201cCinna\u2019s,\u201d says Portia. \n\u201cJust the perfect touch of rebellion,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cVery \n\nnice.\u201d \nRebellion? I have to think about that one a moment. But \n\nwhen I remember the other couples, standing stiffly apart, \nnever touching or acknowledging each other, as if their fellow \ntribute did not exist, as if the Games had already begun, I \nknow what Haymitch means. Presenting ourselves not as ad-\nversaries but as friends has distinguished us as much as the \nfiery costumes. \n\n\u201cTomorrow morning is the first training session. Meet me \nfor breakfast and I\u2019ll tell you exactly how I want you to play \nit,\u201d says Haymitch to Peeta and I. \u201cNow go get some sleep \nwhile the grown-ups talk.\u201d \n\nPeeta and I walk together down the corridor to our rooms. \nWhen we get to my door, he leans against the frame, not \nblocking my entrance exactly but insisting I pay attention to \nhim. \u201cSo, Delly Cartwright. Imagine finding her lookalike \nhere.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s asking for an explanation, and I\u2019m tempted to give him \none. We both know he covered for me. So here I am in his debt \nagain. If I tell him the truth about the girl, somehow that might \neven things up. How can it hurt really? Even if he repeated the \nstory, it couldn\u2019t do me much harm. It was just something I \nwitnessed. And he lied as much as I did about Delly \nCartwright. \n\nI realize I do want to talk to someone about the girl. Some-\none who might be able to help me figure out her story. \n\n\n\n \n\n80 \n \n\nGale would be my first choice, but it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll ever see \nGale again. I try to think if telling Peeta could give him any \npossible advantage over me, but I don\u2019t see how. Maybe shar-\ning a confidence will actually make him believe I see him as a \nfriend. \n\nBesides, the idea of the girl with her maimed tongue frigh-\ntens me. She has reminded me why I\u2019m here. Not to model \nflashy costumes and eat delicacies. But to die a bloody death \nwhile the crowds urge on my killer. \n\nTo tell or not to tell? My brain still feels slow from the wine. \nI stare down the empty corridor as if the decision lies there. \n\nPeeta picks up on my hesitation. \u201cHave you been on the \nroof yet?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cCinna showed me. You can practi-\ncally see the whole city. The wind\u2019s a bit loud, though.\u201d \n\nI translate this into \u201cNo one will overhear us talking\u201d in my \nhead. You do have the sense that we might be under surveil-\nlance here. \u201cCan we just go up?\u201d \n\n\u201cSure, come on,\u201d says Peeta. I follow him to a flight of stairs \nthat lead to the roof. There\u2019s a small dome-shaped room with \na door to the outside. As we step into the cool, windy evening \nair, I catch my breath at the view. The Capitol twinkles like a \nvast field of fireflies. Electricity in District 12 comes and goes, \nusually we only have it a few hours a day. Often the evenings \nare spent in candlelight. The only time you can count on it is \nwhen they\u2019re airing the Games or some important govern-\nment message on television that it\u2019s mandatory to watch. But \nhere there would be no shortage. Ever. \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n \n\nPeeta and I walk to a railing at the edge of the roof. I look \nstraight down the side of the building to the street, which is \nbuzzing with people. You can hear their cars, an occasional \nshout, and a strange metallic tinkling. In District 12, we\u2019d all \nbe thinking about bed right now. \n\n\u201cI asked Cinna why they let us up here. Weren\u2019t they wor-\nried that some of the tributes might decide to jump right over \nthe side?\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d says Peeta. He holds out his hand into seeming-\n\nly empty space. There\u2019s a sharp zap and he jerks it back. \n\u201cSome kind of electric field throws you back on the roof.\u201d \n\n\u201cAlways worried about our safety,\u201d I say. Even though Cin-\nna has shown Peeta the roof, I wonder if we\u2019re supposed to be \nup here now, so late and alone. I\u2019ve never seen tributes on the \nTraining Center roof before. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not \nbeing taped. \u201cDo you think they\u2019re watching us now?\u201d \n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he admits. \u201cCome see the garden.\u201d \nOn the other side of the dome, they\u2019ve built a garden with \n\nflower beds and potted trees. From the branches hang hun-\ndreds of wind chimes, which account for the tinkling I heard. \nHere in the garden, on this windy night, it\u2019s enough to drown \nout two people who are trying not to be heard. Peeta looks at \nme expectantly. \n\nI pretend to examine a blossom. \u201cWe were hunting in the \nwoods one day. Hidden, waiting for game,\u201d I whisper. \n\n\u201cYou and your father?\u201d he whispers back. \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n \n\n\u201cNo, my friend Gale. Suddenly all the birds stopped singing \nat once. Except one. As if it were giving a warning call. And \nthen we saw her. I\u2019m sure it was the same girl. A boy was with \nher. Their clothes were tattered. They had dark circles under \ntheir eyes from no sleep. They were running as if their lives \ndepended on it,\u201d I say. \n\nFor a moment I\u2019m silent, as I remember how the sight of \nthis strange pair, clearly not from District 12, fleeing through \nthe woods immobilized us. Later, we wondered if we could \nhave helped them escape. Perhaps we might have. Concealed \nthem. If we\u2019d moved quickly. Gale and I were taken by sur-\nprise, yes, but we\u2019re both hunters. We know how animals look \nat bay. We knew the pair was in trouble as soon as we saw \nthem. But we only watched. \n\n\u201cThe hovercraft appeared out of nowhere,\u201d I continue to \nPeeta. \u201cI mean, one moment the sky was empty and the next it \nwas there. It didn\u2019t make a sound, but they saw it. A net \ndropped down on the girl and carried her up, fast, so fast like \nthe elevator. They shot some sort of spear through the boy. It \nwas attached to a cable and they hauled him up as well. But \nI\u2019m certain he was dead. We heard the girl scream once. The \nboy\u2019s name, I think. Then it was gone, the hovercraft. Vanished \ninto thin air. And the birds began to sing again, as if nothing \nhad happened.\u201d \n\n\u201cDid they see you?\u201d Peeta asked. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. We were under a shelf of rock,\u201d I reply. \nBut I do know. There was a moment, after the birdcall, but \n\nbefore the hovercraft, where the girl had seen us. She\u2019d locked \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n \n\neyes with me and called out for help. But neither Gale or I had \nresponded. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re shivering,\u201d says Peeta. \nThe wind and the story have blown all the warmth from my \n\nbody. The girl\u2019s scream. Had it been her last? \nPeeta takes off his jacket and wraps it around my shoul-\n\nders. I start to take a step back, but then I let him, deciding for \na moment to accept both his jacket and his kindness. A friend \nwould do that, right? \n\n\u201cThey were from here?\u201d he asks, and he secures a button at \nmy neck. \n\nI nod. They\u2019d had that Capitol look about them. The boy and \nthe girl. \n\n\u201cWhere do you suppose they were going?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know that,\u201d I say. District 12 is pretty much the end \n\nof the line. Beyond us, there\u2019s only wilderness. If you don\u2019t \ncount the ruins of District 13 that still smolder from the toxic \nbombs. They show it on television occasionally, just to remind \nus. \u201cOr why they would leave here.\u201d Haymitch had called the \nAvoxes traitors. Against what? It could only be the Capitol. But \nthey had everything here. No cause to rebel. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d leave here,\u201d Peeta blurts out. Then he looks around \nnervously. It was loud enough to hear above the chimes. He \nlaughs. \u201cI\u2019d go home now if they let me. But you have to admit, \nthe food\u2019s prime.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s covered again. If that\u2019s all you\u2019d heard it would just \nsound like the words of a scared tribute, not someone con-\ntemplating the unquestionable goodness of the Capitol. \n\n\n\n \n\n84 \n \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting chilly. We better go in,\u201d he says. Inside the \ndome, it\u2019s warm and bright. His tone is conversational. \u201cYour \nfriend Gale. He\u2019s the one who took your sister away at the \nreaping?\u201d \n\n\u201cYes. Do you know him?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNot really. I hear the girls talk about him a lot. I thought he \n\nwas your cousin or something. You favor each other,\u201d he says. \n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not related,\u201d I say. \nPeeta nods, unreadable. \u201cDid he come to say good-bye to \n\nyou?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, observing him carefully. \u201cSo did your father. He \n\nbrought me cookies.\u201d \nPeeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. But after \n\nwatching him lie so smoothly, I don\u2019t give this much weight. \n\u201cReally? Well, he likes you and your sister. I think he wishes \nhe had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.\u201d \n\nThe idea that I might ever have been discussed, around the \ndinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in Peeta\u2019s house \ngives me a start. It must have been when the mother was out \nof the room. \n\n\u201cHe knew your mother when they were kids,\u201d says Peeta. \nAnother surprise. But probably true. \u201cOh, yes. She grew up \n\nin town,\u201d I say. It seems impolite to say she never mentioned \nthe baker except to compliment his bread. \n\nWe\u2019re at my door. I give back his jacket. \u201cSee you in the \nmorning then.\u201d \n\n\u201cSee you,\u201d he says, and walks off down the hall. \n\n\n\n \n\n85 \n \n\nWhen I open my door, the redheaded girl is collecting my \nunitard and boots from where I left them on the floor before \nmy shower. I want to apologize for possibly getting her in \ntrouble earlier. But I remember I\u2019m not supposed to speak to \nher unless I\u2019m giving her an order. \n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d I say. \u201cI was supposed to get those back to Cin-\nna. I\u2019m sorry. Can you take them to him?\u201d \n\nShe avoids my eyes, gives a small nod, and heads out the \ndoor. \n\nI\u2019d set out to tell her I was sorry about dinner. But I know \nthat my apology runs much deeper. That I\u2019m ashamed I never \ntried to help her in the woods. That I let the Capitol kill the \nboy and mutilate her without lifting a finger. \n\nJust like I was watching the Games. \nI kick off my shoes and climb under the covers in my \n\nclothes. The shivering hasn\u2019t stopped. Perhaps the girl doesn\u2019t \neven remember me. But I know she does. You don\u2019t forget the \nface of the person who was your last hope. I pull the covers up \nover my head as if this will protect me from the redheaded girl \nwho can\u2019t speak. But I can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing \nthrough walls and doors and bedding. \n\nI wonder if she\u2019ll enjoy watching me die. \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n \n\n \n \n \nMy slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. The face of \n\nthe redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier \nHunger Games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, \nwith Prim emaciated and terrified. I bolt up screaming for my \nfather to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of \nlight. \n\nDawn is breaking through the windows. The Capitol has a \nmisty, haunted air. My head aches and I must have bitten into \nthe side of my cheek in the night. My tongue probes the \nragged flesh and I taste blood. \n\nSlowly, I drag myself out of bed and into the shower. I arbi-\ntrarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hop-\nping from foot to foot as alternating jets of icy cold and steam-\ning hot water assault me. Then I\u2019m deluged in lemony foam \nthat I have to scrape off with a heavy bristled brush. Oh, well. \nAt least my blood is flowing. \n\nWhen I\u2019m dried and moisturized with lotion, I find an outfit \nhas been left for me at the front of the closet. Tight black \npants, a long-sleeved burgundy tunic, and leather shoes. I put \nmy hair in the single braid down my back. This is the first time \nsince the morning of the reaping that I resemble myself. No \n\n\n\n \n\n87 \n \n\nfancy hair and clothes, no flaming capes. Just me. Looking like \nI could be headed for the woods. It calms me. \n\nHaymitch didn\u2019t give us an exact time to meet for break-last \nand no one has contacted me this morning, but I\u2019m hungry so I \nhead down to the dining room, hoping there will be food. I\u2019m \nnot disappointed. While the table is empty, a long board off to \nthe side has been laid with at least twenty dishes. A young \nman, an Avox, stands at attention by the spread. When I ask if \nI can serve myself, he nods assent. I load a plate with eggs, \nsausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slic-\nes of pale purple melon. As I gorge myself, I watch the sun rise \nover the Capitol. I have a second plate of hot grain smothered \nin beef stew. Finally, I fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, \nbreaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way \nPeeta did on the train. \n\nMy mind wanders to my mother and Prim. They must be \nup. My mother getting their breakfast of mush. Prim milking \nher goat before school. Just two mornings ago, I was home. \nCan that be right? Yes, just two. And now how empty the \nhouse feels, even from a distance. What did they say last night \nabout my fiery debut at the Games? Did it give them hope, or \nsimply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twen-\nty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live? \n\nHaymitch and Peeta come in, bid me good morning, fill \ntheir plates. It makes me irritated that Peeta is wearing exact-\nly the same outfit I am. I need to say something to Cinna. This \ntwins act is going to blow up in out faces once the Games be-\ngin. Surely, they must know this. Then I remember Haymitch \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n \n\ntelling me to do exactly what the stylists tell me to do. If it was \nanyone but Cinna, I might be tempted to ignore him. But after \nlast night\u2019s triumph, I don\u2019t have a lot of room to criticize his \nchoices. \n\nI\u2019m nervous about the training. There will be three days in \nwhich all the tributes practice together. On the last afternoon, \nwe\u2019ll each get a chance to perform in private before the Ga-\nmemakers. The thought of meeting the other tributes face-to-\nface makes me queasy. I turn the roll I have just taken from \nthe basket over and over in my hands, but my appetite is gone. \n\nWhen Haymitch has finished several platters of stew, he \npushes back his plate with a sigh. He takes a flask from his \npocket and takes a long pull on it and leans his elbows on the \ntable. \u201cSo, let\u2019s get down to business. Training. First off, if you \nlike, I\u2019ll coach you separately. Decide now.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy would you coach us separately?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cSay if you had a secret skill you might not want the other \n\nto know about,\u201d says Haymitch. \nI exchange a look with Peeta. \u201cI don\u2019t have any secret \n\nskills,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I already know what yours is, right? I \nmean, I\u2019ve eaten enough of your squirrels.\u201d \n\nI never thought about Peeta eating the squirrels I shot. \nSomehow I always pictured the baker quietly going off and \nfrying them up for himself. Not out of greed. But because town \nfamilies usually eat expensive butcher meat. Beef and chicken \nand horse. \n\n\u201cYou can coach us together,\u201d I tell Haymitch. Peeta nods. \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n \n\n\u201cAll right, so give me some idea of what you can do,\u201d says \nHaymitch. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do anything,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cUnless you count baking \nbread.\u201d \n\n\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t. Katniss. I already know you\u2019re handy with a \nknife,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cNot really. But I can hunt,\u201d I say. \u201cWith a bow and arrow.\u201d \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re good?\u201d asks Haymitch. \nI have to think about it. I\u2019ve been putting food on the table \n\nfor four years. That\u2019s no small task. I\u2019m not as good as my fa-\nther was, but he\u2019d had more practice. I\u2019ve better aim than \nGale, but I\u2019ve had more practice. He\u2019s a genius with traps and \nsnares. \u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s excellent,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cMy father buys her squirrels. \nHe always comments on how the arrows never pierce the \nbody. She hits every one in the eye. It\u2019s the same with the rab-\nbits she sells the butcher. She can even bring down deer.\u201d \n\nThis assessment of my skills from Peeta takes me totally by \nsurprise. First, that he ever noticed. Second, that he\u2019s talking \nme up. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I ask him suspiciously. \n\n\u201cWhat are you doing? If he\u2019s going to help you, he has to \nknow what you\u2019re capable of. Don\u2019t underrate yourself,\u201d says \nPeeta. \n\nI don\u2019t know why, but this rubs me the wrong way. \u201cWhat \nabout you? I\u2019ve seen you in the market. You can lift hundred-\npound bags of flour,\u201d I snap at him. \u201cTell him that. That\u2019s not \nnothing.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n \n\n\u201cYes, and I\u2019m sure the arena will be full of bags of flour for \nme to chuck at people. It\u2019s not like being able to use a weapon. \nYou know it isn\u2019t,\u201d he shoots back. \n\n\u201cHe can wrestle,\u201d I tell Haymitch. \u201cHe came in second in our \nschool competition last year, only after his brother.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat use is that? How many times have you seen someone \nwrestle someone to death?\u201d says Peeta in disgust. \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always hand-to-hand combat. All you need is to \ncome up with a knife, and you\u2019ll at least stand a chance. If I get \njumped, I\u2019m dead!\u201d I can hear my voice rising in anger. \n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t! You\u2019ll be living up in some tree eating raw \nsquirrels and picking off people with arrows. You know what \nmy mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to \ncheer me up, she says maybe District Twelve will finally have \na winner. Then I realized, she didn\u2019t mean me, she meant \nyou!\u201d bursts out Peeta. \n\n\u201cOh, she meant you,\u201d I say with a wave of dismissal. \n\u201cShe said, \u2018She\u2019s a survivor, that one.\u2019 She is,\u201d says Peeta. \nThat pulls me up short. Did his mother really say that about \n\nme? Did she rate me over her son? I see the pain in Peeta\u2019s \neyes and know he isn\u2019t lying. \n\nSuddenly I\u2019m behind the bakery and I can feel the chill of \nthe rain running down my back, the hollowness in my belly. I \nsound eleven years old when I speak. \u201cBut only because \nsomeone helped me.\u201d \n\nPeeta\u2019s eyes flicker down to the roll in my hands, and I \nknow he remembers that day, too. But he just shrugs. \u201cPeople \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n \n\nwill help you in the arena. They\u2019ll be tripping over each other \nto sponsor you.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo more than you,\u201d I say. \nPeeta rolls his eyes at Haymitch. \u201cShe has no idea. The ef-\n\nfect she can have.\u201d He runs his fingernail along the wood grain \nin the table, refusing to look at me. \n\nWhat on earth does he mean? People help me? When we \nwere dying of starvation, no one helped me! No one except \nPeeta. Once I had something to barter with, things changed. \nI\u2019m a tough trader. Or am I? What effect do I have? That I\u2019m \nweak and needy? Is he suggesting that I got good deals be-\ncause people pitied me? I try to think if this is true. Perhaps \nsome of the merchants were a little generous in their trades, \nbut I always attributed that to their long-standing relationship \nwith my father. Besides, my game is first-class. No one pitied \nme! \n\nI glower at the roll sure he meant to insult me. \nAfter about a minute of this, Haymitch says, \u201cWell, then. \n\nWell, well, well. Katniss, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be bows \nand arrows in the arena, but during your private session with \nthe Gamemakers, show them what you can do. Until then, stay \nclear of archery. Are you any good at trapping?\u201d \n\n\u201cI know a few basic snares,\u201d I mutter. \n\u201cThat may be significant in terms of food,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cAnd Peeta, she\u2019s right, never underestimate strength in the \narena. Very often, physical power tilts the advantage to a \nplayer. In the Training Center, they will have weights, but \ndon\u2019t reveal how much you can lift in front of the other tri-\n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n \n\nbutes. The plan\u2019s the same for both of you. You go to group \ntraining. Spend the time trying to learn something you don\u2019t \nknow. Throw a spear. Swing a mace. Learn to tie a decent \nknot. Save showing what you\u2019re best at until your private ses-\nsions. Are we clear?\u201d says Haymitch. Peeta and I nod. \n\n\u201cOne last thing. In public, I want you by each other\u2019s side \nevery minute,\u201d says Haymitch. We both start to object, but \nHaymitch slams his hand on the table. \u201cEvery minute! It\u2019s not \nopen for discussion! You agreed to do as I said! You will be to-\ngether, you will appear amiable to each other. Now get out. \nMeet Effie at the elevator at ten for training.\u201d \n\nI bite my lip and stalk back to my room, making sure Peeta \ncan hear the door slam. I sit on the bed, hating Haymitch, hat-\ning Peeta, hating myself for mentioning that day long ago in \nthe rain. \n\nIt\u2019s such a joke! Peeta and I going along pretending to be \nfriends! Talking up each other\u2019s strengths, insisting the other \ntake credit for their abilities. Because, in fact, at some point, \nwe\u2019re going to have to knock it off and accept we\u2019re bitter ad-\nversaries. Which I\u2019d be prepared to do right now if it wasn\u2019t \nfor Haymitch\u2019s stupid instruction that we stick together in \ntraining. It\u2019s my own fault, I guess, for telling him he didn\u2019t \nhave to coach us separately. But that didn\u2019t mean I wanted to \ndo everything with Peeta. Who, by the way, clearly doesn\u2019t \nwant to be partnering up with me, either. \n\nI hear Peeta\u2019s voice in my head. She has no idea. The effect \n\nshe can have. Obviously meant to demean me. Right? but a tiny \npart of me wonders if this was a compliment. That he meant I \n\n\n\n \n\n93 \n \n\nwas appealing in some way. It\u2019s weird, how much he\u2019s noticed \nme. Like the attention he\u2019s paid to my hunting. And apparent-\nly, I have not been as oblivious to him as I imagined, either. \nThe flour. The wrestling. I have kept track of the boy with the \nbread. \n\nIt\u2019s almost ten. I clean my teeth and smooth back my hair \nagain. Anger temporarily blocked out my nervousness about \nmeeting the other tributes, but now I can feel my anxiety ris-\ning again. By the time I meet Effie and Peeta at the elevator, I \ncatch myself biting my nails. I stop at once. \n\nThe actual training rooms are below ground level of our \nbuilding. With these elevators, the ride is less than a minute. \nThe doors open into an enormous gymnasium filled with vari-\nous weapons and obstacle courses. Although it\u2019s not yet ten, \nwe\u2019re the last ones to arrive. The other tributes are gathered \nin a tense circle. They each have a cloth square with their dis-\ntrict number on it pinned to their shirts. While someone pins \nthe number 12 on my back, I do a quick assessment. Peeta and \nI are the only two dressed alike. \n\nAs soon as we join the circle, the head trainer, a tall, athletic \nwoman named Atala steps up and begins to explain the train-\ning schedule. Experts in each skill will remain at their stations. \nWe will be free to travel from area to area as we choose, per \nour mentor\u2019s instructions. Some of the stations teach survival \nskills, others fighting techniques. We are forbidden to engage \nin any combative exercise with another tribute. There are as-\nsistants on hand if we want to practice with a partner. \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n \n\nWhen Atala begins to read down the list of the skill sta-\ntions, my eyes can\u2019t help flitting around to the other tributes. \nIt\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve been assembled, on level ground, in \nsimple clothes. My heart sinks. Almost all of the boys and at \nleast half of the girls are bigger than I am, even though many \nof the tributes have never been fed properly. You can see it in \ntheir bones, their skin, the hollow look in their eyes. I may be \nsmaller naturally, but overall my family\u2019s resourcefulness has \ngiven me an edge in that area. I stand straight, and while I\u2019m \nthin, I\u2019m strong. The meat and plants from the woods com-\nbined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a \nhealthier body than most of those I see around me. \n\nThe exceptions are the kids from the wealthier districts, the \nvolunteers, the ones who have been fed and trained through-\nout their lives for this moment. The tributes from 1, 2, and 4 \ntraditionally have this look about them. It\u2019s technically against \nthe rules to train tributes before they reach the Capitol but it \nhappens every year. In District 12, we call them the Career \nTributes, or just the Careers. And like as not, the winner will \nbe one of them. \n\nThe slight advantage I held coming into the Training Cen-\nter, my fiery entrance last night, seems to vanish in the pres-\nence of my competition. The other tributes were jealous of us, \nbut not because we were amazing, because our stylists were. \nNow I see nothing but contempt in the glances of the Career \nTributes. Each must have fifty to a hundred pounds on me. \nThey project arrogance and brutality. When Atala releases us, \n\n\n\n \n\n95 \n \n\nthey head straight for the deadliest-looking weapons in the \ngym and handle them with ease. \n\nI\u2019m thinking that it\u2019s lucky I\u2019m a fast runner when Peeta \nnudges my arm and I jump. He is still beside me, per Hay-\nmitch\u2019s instructions. His expression is sober. \u201cWhere would \nyou like to start?\u201d \n\nI look around at the Career Tributes who are showing off, \nclearly trying to intimidate the field. Then at the others, the \nunderfed, the incompetent, shakily having their first lessons \nwith a knife or an ax. \n\n\u201cSuppose we tie some knots,\u201d I say. \n\u201cRight you are,\u201d says Peeta. We cross to an empty station \n\nwhere the trainer seems pleased to have students. You get the \nfeeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger games hot \nspot. When he realizes I know something about snares, he \nshows us a simple, excellent trap that will leave a human \ncompetitor dangling by a leg from a tree. We concentrate on \nthis one skill for an hour until both of us have mastered it. \nThen we move on to camouflage. Peeta genuinely seems to en-\njoy this station, swirling a combination of mud and clay and \nberry juices around on his pale skin, weaving disguises from \nvines and leaves. The trainer who runs the camouflage station \nis full of enthusiasm at his work. \n\n\u201cI do the cakes,\u201d he admits to me. \n\u201cThe cakes?\u201d I ask. I\u2019ve been preoccupied with watching the \n\nboy from District 2 send a spear through a dummy\u2019s heart \nfrom fifteen yards. \u201cWhat cakes?\u201d \n\n\u201cAt home. The iced ones, for the bakery,\u201d he says. \n\n\n\n \n\n96 \n \n\nHe means the ones they display in the windows. Fancy \ncakes with flowers and pretty things painted in frosting. \nThey\u2019re for birthdays and New Year\u2019s Day. When we\u2019re in the \nsquare, Prim always drags me over to admire them, although \nwe\u2019d never be able to afford one. There\u2019s little enough beauty \nin District 12, though, so I can hardly deny her this. \n\nI look more critically at the design on Peeta\u2019s arm. The al-\nternating pattern of light and dark suggests sunlight falling \nthrough the leaves in the woods. I wonder how he knows this, \nsince I doubt he\u2019s ever been beyond the fence. Has he been \nable to pick this up from just that scraggly old apple tree in his \nbackyard? Somehow the whole thing \u2014 his skill, those inac-\ncessible cakes, the praise of the camouflage expert \u2014 annoys \nme. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,\u201d I say. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be so superior. You can never tell what you\u2019ll find in \n\nthe arena. Say it\u2019s actually a gigantic cake \u2014\u201d begins Peeta. \n\u201cSay we move on,\u201d I break in. \nSo the next three days pass with Peeta and I going quietly \n\nfrom station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, \nfrom starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. De-\nspite Haymitch\u2019s order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in \nhand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test with-\nout blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlift-\ning though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. \n\nThe Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty \nor so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit \nin the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, some-\n\n\n\n \n\n97 \n \n\ntimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other \ntimes eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, \nignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye \non the District 12 tributes. Several times I\u2019ve looked up to find \none fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our \nmeals as well. We see them all gathered together when we \ncome back. \n\nBreakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch \nthe twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. \nFood is arranged on carts around the room and you serve \nyourself. The Career Tributes tend to gather rowdily around \none table, as if to prove their superiority, that they have no \nfear of one another and consider the rest of us beneath notice. \nMost of the other tributes sit alone, like lost sheep. No one \nsays a word to us. Peeta and I eat together, and since Hay-\nmitch keeps dogging us about it, try to keep up a friendly con-\nversation during the meals. \n\nIt\u2019s not easy to find a topic. Talking of home is painful. Talk-\ning of the present unbearable. One day, Peeta empties our \nbreadbasket and points out how they have been careful to in-\nclude types from the districts along with the refined bread of \nthe Capitol. The fish-shaped loaf tinted green with seaweed \nfrom District 4. The crescent moon roll dotted with seeds from \nDistrict 11. Somehow, although it\u2019s made from the same stuff, \nit looks a lot more appetizing than the ugly drop biscuits that \nare the standard fare at home. \n\n\u201cAnd there you have it,\u201d says Peeta, scooping the breads \nback in the basket. \n\n\n\n \n\n98 \n \n\n\u201cYou certainly know a lot,\u201d I say. \n\u201cOnly about bread,\u201d he says. \u201cOkay, now laugh as if I\u2019ve said \n\nsomething funny.\u201d \nWe both give a somewhat convincing laugh and ignore the \n\nstares from around the room. \n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll keep smiling pleasantly and you talk,\u201d says \n\nPeeta. It\u2019s wearing us both out, Haymitch\u2019s direction to be \nfriendly. Because ever since I slammed my door, there\u2019s been \na chill in the air between us. But we have our orders. \n\n\u201cDid I ever tell you about the time I was chased by a bear?\u201d \nI ask. \n\n\u201cNo, but it sounds fascinating,\u201d says Peeta. \nI try and animate my face as I recall the event, a true story, \n\nin which I\u2019d foolishly challenged a black bear over the rights \nto a beehive. Peeta laughs and asks questions right on cue. \nHe\u2019s much better at this than I am. \n\nOn the second day, while we\u2019re taking a shot at spear \nthrowing, he whispers to me. \u201cI think we have a shadow.\u201d \n\nI throw my spear, which I\u2019m not too bad at actually, if I \ndon\u2019t have to throw too far, and see the little girl from District \n11 standing back a bit, watching us. She\u2019s the twelve-year-old, \nthe one who reminded me so of Prim in stature. Up close she \nlooks about ten. She has bright, dark, eyes and satiny brown \nskin and stands tilted up on her toes with her arms slightly ex-\ntended to her sides, as if ready to take wing at the slightest \nsound. It\u2019s impossible not to think of a bird. \n\nI pick up another spear while Peeta throws. \u201cI think her \nname\u2019s Rue,\u201d he says softly. \n\n\n\n \n\n99 \n \n\nI bite my lip. Rue is a small yellow flower that grows in the \nMeadow. Rue. Primrose. Neither of them could tip the scale at \nseventy pounds soaking wet. \n\n\u201cWhat can we do about it?\u201d I ask him, more harshly than I \nintended. \n\n\u201cNothing to do,\u201d he says back. \u201cJust making conversation.\u201d \nNow that I know she\u2019s there, it\u2019s hard to ignore the child. \n\nShe slips up and joins us at different stations. Like me, she\u2019s \nclever with plants, climbs swiftly, and has good aim. She can \nhit the target every time with a slingshot. But what is a sling-\nshot against a 220-pound male with a sword? \n\nBack on the District 12 floor, Haymitch and Effie grill us \nthroughout breakfast and dinner about every moment of the \nday. What we did, who watched us, how the other tributes size \nup. Cinna and Portia aren\u2019t around, so there\u2019s no one to add \nany sanity to the meals. Not that Haymitch and Effie are fight-\ning anymore. Instead they seem to be of one mind, determined \nto whip us into shape. Full of endless directions about what \nwe should do and not do in training. Peeta is more patient, but \nI become fed up and surly. \n\nWhen we finally escape to bed on the second night, Peeta \nmumbles, \u201cSomeone ought to get Haymitch a drink.\u201d \n\nI make a sound that is somewhere between a snort and a \nlaugh. Then catch myself. It\u2019s messing with my mind too much, \ntrying to keep straight when we\u2019re supposedly friends and \nwhen we\u2019re not. At least when we get into the arena, I\u2019ll know \nwhere we stand. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t let\u2019s pretend when there\u2019s no \none around.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n100 \n \n\n\u201cAll right, Katniss,\u201d he says tiredly. After that, we only talk \nin front of people. \n\nOn the third day of training, they start to call us out of lunch \nfor our private sessions with the Gamemakers. District by dis-\ntrict, first the boy, then the girl tribute. As usual, District 12 is \nslated to go last. We linger in the dining room, unsure where \nelse to go. No one comes back once they have left. As the room \nempties, the pressure to appear friendly lightens. By the time \nthey call Rue, we are left alone. We sit in silence until they \nsummon Peeta. He rises. \n\n\u201cRemember what Haymitch said about being sure to throw \nthe weights.\u201d The words come out of my mouth without per-\nmission. \n\n\u201cThanks. I will,\u201d he says. \u201cYou . . . shoot straight.\u201d \nI nod. I don\u2019t know why I said anything at all. Although if \n\nI\u2019m going to lose, I\u2019d rather Peeta win than the others. Better \nfor our district, for my mother and Prim. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes, they call my name. I smooth my \nhair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. In-\nstantly, I know I\u2019m in trouble. They\u2019ve been here too long, the \nGamemakers. Sat through twenty-three other demonstrations. \nHad too much to wine, most of them. Want more than any-\nthing to go home. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can do but continue with the plan. I walk \nto the archery station. Oh, the weapons! I\u2019ve been itching to \nget my hands on them for days! Bows made of wood and plas-\ntic and metal and materials I can\u2019t even name. Arrows with \nfeathers cut in flawless uniform lines. I choose a bow, string it, \n\n\n\n \n\n101 \n \n\nand sling the matching quiver of arrows over my shoulder. \nThere\u2019s a shooting range, but it\u2019s much too limited. Standard \nbull\u2019s-eyes and human silhouettes. I walk to the center of the \ngymnasium and pick my first target. The dummy used for \nknife practice. Even as I pull back on the bow I know some-\nthing is wrong. The string\u2019s tighter than the one I use at home. \nThe arrow\u2019s more rigid. I miss the dummy by a couple of inch-\nes and lose what little attention I had been commanding. For a \nmoment, I\u2019m humiliated, then I head back to the bull\u2019s-eye. I \nshoot again and again until I get the feel of these new wea-\npons. \n\nBack in the center of the gymnasium, I take my initial posi-\ntion and skewer the dummy right through the heart. Then I \nsever the rope that holds the sandbag for boxing, and the bag \nsplits open as it slams to the ground. Without pausing, I \nshoulder-roll forward, come up on one knee, and send an ar-\nrow into one of the hanging lights high above the gymnasium \nfloor. A shower of sparks bursts from the fixture. \n\nIt\u2019s excellent shooting. I turn to the Gamemakers. A few are \nnodding approval, but the majority of them are fixated on a \nroast pig that has just arrived at their banquet table. \n\nSuddenly I am furious, that with my life on the line, they \ndon\u2019t even have the decency to pay attention to me. That I\u2019m \nbeing upstaged by a dead pig. My heart starts to pound, I can \nfeel my face burning. Without thinking, I pull an arrow from \nmy quiver and send it straight at the Gamemakers\u2019 table. I \nhear shouts of alarm as people stumble back. The arrow \n\n\n\n \n\n102 \n \n\nskewers the apple in the pig\u2019s mouth and pins it to the wall \nbehind it. Everyone stares at me in disbelief. \n\n\u201cThank you for your consideration,\u201d I say. Then I give a \nslight bow and walk straight toward the exit without being \ndismissed.\n\n\n\n \n\n103 \n \n\n \n \n \nAs I stride toward the elevator, I fling my bow to one side \n\nand my quiver to the other. I brush past the gaping Avoxes \nwho guard the elevators and hit the number twelve button \nwith my fist. The doors slide together and I zip upward. I ac-\ntually make it back to my floor before the tears start running \ndown my cheeks. I can hear the others calling me from the sit-\nting room, but I fly down the hall into my room, bolt the door, \nand fling myself onto my bed. Then I really begin to sob. \n\nNow I\u2019ve done it! Now I\u2019ve ruined everything! If I\u2019d stood \neven a ghost of chance, it vanished when I sent that arrow fly-\ning at the Gamemakers. What will they do to me now? Arrest \nme? Execute me? Cut my tongue and turn me into an Avox so I \ncan wait on the future tributes of Panem? What was I thinking, \nshooting at the Gamemakers? Of course, I wasn\u2019t, I was shoot-\ning at that apple because I was so angry at being ignored. I \nwasn\u2019t trying to kill one of them. If I were, they\u2019d be dead! \n\nOh, what does it matter? It\u2019s not like I was going to win the \nGames anyway. Who cares what they do to me? What really \nscares me is what they might do to my mother and Prim, how \nmy family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. Will \nthey take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison \n\n\n\n \n\n104 \n \n\nand Prim to the community home, or kill them? They wouldn\u2019t \nkill them, would they? Why not? What do they care? \n\nI should have stayed and apologized. Or laughed, like it was \na big joke. Then maybe I would have found some leniency. But \ninstead I stalked out of the place in the most disrespectful \nmanner possible. \n\nHaymitch and Effie are knocking on my door. I shout for \nthem to go away and eventually they do. It takes at least an \nhour for me to cry myself out. Then I just lay curled up on the \nbed, stroking the silken sheets, watching the sun set over the \nartificial candy Capitol. \n\nAt first, I expect guards to come for me. But as time passes, \nit seems less likely. I calm down. They still need a girl tribute \nfrom District 12, don\u2019t they? If the Gamemakers want to pu-\nnish me, they can do it publicly. Wait until I\u2019m in the arena and \nsic starving wild animals on me. You can bet they\u2019ll make sure \nI don\u2019t have a bow and arrow to defend myself. \n\nBefore that though, they\u2019ll give me a score so low, no one in \ntheir right mind would sponsor me. That\u2019s what will happen \ntonight. Since the training isn\u2019t open to viewers, the Game-\nmakers announce a score for each player. It gives the audience \na starting place for the betting that will continue throughout \nthe Games. The number, which is between one and twelve, \none being irredeemably bad and twelve being unattainably \nhigh, signifies the promise of the tribute. The mark is not a \nguarantee of which person will win. It\u2019s only an indication of \nthe potential a tribute showed in training. Often, because of \nthe variables in the actual arena, high-scoring tributes go \n\n\n\n \n\n105 \n \n\ndown almost immediately. And a few years ago, the boy who \nwon the Games only received a three. Still, the scores can help \nor hurt an individual tribute in terms of sponsorship. I had \nbeen hoping my shooting skills might get me a six or a seven, \neven if I\u2019m not particularly powerful. Now I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll have \nthe lowest score of the twenty-four. If no one sponsors me, my \nodds of staying alive decrease to almost zero. \n\nWhen Effie taps on the door to call me to dinner, I decide I \nmay as well go. The scores will be televised tonight. It\u2019s not \nlike I can hide what happened forever. I go to the bathroom \nand wash my face, but it\u2019s still red and splotchy. \n\nEveryone\u2019s waiting at the table, even Cinna and Portia. I \nwish the stylists hadn\u2019t shown up because for some reason, I \ndon\u2019t like the idea of disappointing them. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve thrown \naway all the good work they did on the opening ceremonies \nwithout a thought. I avoid looking at anyone as I take tiny \nspoonfuls of fish soup. The saltiness reminds me of my tears. \n\nThe adults begin some chitchat about the weather forecast, \nand I let my eyes meet Peeta\u2019s. He raises his eyebrows. A ques-\ntion. What happened? I just give my head a small shake. Then, \nas they\u2019re serving the main course, I hear Haymitch say, \n\u201cOkay, enough small talk, just how bad were you today?\u201d \n\nPeeta jumps in. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it mattered. By the time I \nshowed up, no one even bothered to look at me. They were \nsinging some kind of drinking song, I think. So, I threw around \nsome heavy objects until they told me I could go.\u201d \n\nThat makes me feel a bit better. It\u2019s not like Peeta attacked \nthe Gamemakers, but at least he was provoked, too. \n\n\n\n \n\n106 \n \n\n\u201cAnd you, sweetheart?\u201d says Haymitch. \nSomehow Haymitch calling me sweetheart ticks me off \n\nenough that I\u2019m at least able to speak. \u201cI shot an arrow at the \nGamemakers.\u201d \n\nEveryone stops eating. \u201cYou what?\u201d The horror in Effie\u2019s \nvoice confirms my worse suspicions. \n\n\u201cI shot an arrow at them. Not exactly at them. In their direc-\ntion. It\u2019s like Peeta said, I was shooting and they were ignoring \nme and I just . . . I just lost my head, so I shot an apple out of \ntheir stupid roast pig\u2019s mouth!\u201d I say defiantly. \n\n\u201cAnd what did they say?\u201d says Cinna carefully. \n\u201cNothing. Or I don\u2019t know. I walked out after that,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWithout being dismissed?\u201d gasps Effie. \n\u201cI dismissed myself,\u201d I said. I remember how I promised \n\nPrim that I really would try to win and I feel like a ton of coal \nhas dropped on me. \n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d says Haymitch. Then he butters a roll. \n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll arrest me?\u201d I ask. \u201cDoubt it. Be a pain \n\nto replace you at this stage,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\u201cWhat about my family?\u201d I say. \u201cWill they punish them?\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t think so. Wouldn\u2019t make much sense. See they\u2019d \n\nhave to reveal what happened in the Training Center for it to \nhave any worthwhile effect on the population. People would \nneed to know what you did. But they can\u2019t since it\u2019s secret, so \nit\u2019d be a waste of effort,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cMore likely they\u2019ll \nmake your life hell in the arena.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ve already promised to do that to us any way,\u201d \nsays Peeta. \n\n\n\n \n\n107 \n \n\n\u201cVery true,\u201d says Haymitch. And I realize the impossible has \nhappened. They have actually cheered me up. Haymitch picks \nup a pork chop with his fingers, which makes Effie frown, and \ndunks it in his wine. He rips off a hunk of meat and starts to \nchuckle. \u201cWhat were their faces like?\u201d \n\nI can feel the edges of my mouth tilting up. \u201cShocked. Terri-\nfied. Uh, ridiculous, some of them.\u201d An image pops into my \nmind. \u201cOne man tripped backward into a bowl of punch.\u201d \n\nHaymitch guffaws and we all start laughing except Effie, al-\nthough even she is suppressing a smile. \u201cWell, it serves them \nright. It\u2019s their job to pay attention to you. And just because \nyou come from District Twelve is no excuse to ignore you.\u201d \nThen her eyes dart around as if she\u2019s said something totally \noutrageous. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but that\u2019s what I think,\u201d she says to no \none in particular. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a very bad score,\u201d I say. \n\u201cScores only matter if they\u2019re very good, no one pays much \n\nattention to the bad or mediocre ones. For all they know, you \ncould be hiding your talents to get a low score on purpose. \nPeople use that strategy,\u201d said Portia. \n\n\u201cI hope that\u2019s how people interpret the four I\u2019ll probably \nget,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cIf that. Really, is anything less impressive \nthan watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a \ncouple of yards. One almost landed on my foot.\u201d \n\nI grin at him and realize that I\u2019m starving. I cut off a piece of \npork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. It\u2019s okay. \nMy family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been \ndone. \n\n\n\n \n\n108 \n \n\nAfter dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores an-\nnounced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, \nthen flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally \nget in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players aver-\nage a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I \ndon\u2019t know what she showed the judges, but she\u2019s so tiny it \nmust have been impressive. \n\nDistrict 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight so at \nleast a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching \nhim. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, \nexpecting the worst. Then they\u2019re flashing the number eleven \non the screen. \n\nEleven! \nEffie Trinket lets out a squeal, and everybody is slapping \n\nme on the back and cheering and congratulating me. But it \ndoesn\u2019t seem real. \n\n\u201cThere must be a mistake. How . . . how could that happen?\u201d \nI ask Haymitch. \n\n\u201cGuess they liked your temper,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a \nshow to put on. They need some players with some heat.\u201d \n\n\u201cKatniss, the girl who was on fire,\u201d says Cinna and gives me \na hug. \u201cOh, wait until you see your interview dress.\u201d \u201cMore \nflames?\u201d I ask. \u201cOf a sort,\u201d he says mischievously. \n\nPeeta and I congratulate each other, another awkward \nmoment. We\u2019ve both done well, but what does that mean for \nthe other? I escape to my room as quickly as possible and bur-\nrow down under the covers. The stress of the day, particularly \n\n\n\n \n\n109 \n \n\nthe crying, has worn me out. I drift off, reprieved, relieved, \nand with the number eleven still flashing behind my eyelids. \n\nAt dawn, I lie in bed for a while, watching the sun come up \non a beautiful morning. It\u2019s Sunday. A day off at home. I won-\nder if Gale is in the woods yet. Usually we devote all of Sunday \nto stocking up for the week. Rising early, hunting and gather-\ning, then trading at the Hob. I think of Gale without me. Both \nof us can hunt alone, but we\u2019re better as a pair. Particularly if \nwe\u2019re trying for bigger game. But also in the littler things, hav-\ning a partner lightened the load, could even make the arduous \ntask of filling my family\u2019s table enjoyable. \n\nI had been struggling along on my own for about six \nmonths when I first ran into Gale in the woods. It was a Sun-\nday in October, the air cool and pungent with dying things. I\u2019d \nspent the morning competing with the squirrels for nuts and \nthe slightly warmer afternoon wading in shallow ponds har-\nvesting katniss. The only meat I\u2019d shot was a squirrel that had \npractically run over my toes in its quest for acorns, but the an-\nimals would still be afoot when the snow buried my other \nfood sources. Having strayed farther afield than usual, I was \nhurrying back home, lugging my burlap sacks when I came \nacross a dead rabbit. It was hanging by its neck in a thin wire a \nfoot above my head. About fifteen yards away was another. I \nrecognized the twitch-up snares because my father had used \nthem. When the prey is caught, it\u2019s yanked into the air out of \nthe reach of other hungry animals. I\u2019d been trying to use \nsnares all summer with no success, so I couldn\u2019t help dropping \nmy sacks to examine this one. My fingers were just on the wire \n\n\n\n \n\n110 \n \n\nabove one of the rabbits when a voice rang out. \u201cThat\u2019s dan-\ngerous.\u201d \n\nI jumped back several feet as Gale materialized from be-\nhind a tree. He must have been watching me the whole time. \nHe was only fourteen, but he cleared six feet and was as good \nas an adult to me. I\u2019d seen him around the Seam and at school. \nAnd one other time. He\u2019d lost his father in the same blast that \nkilled mine. In January, I\u2019d stood by while he received his \nmedal of valor in the Justice Building, another oldest child \nwith no father. I remembered his two little brothers clutching \nhis mother, a woman whose swollen belly announced she was \njust days away from giving birth. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d he said, coming over and disengaging \nthe rabbit from the snare. He had another three hanging from \nhis belt. \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d I said, barely audible. \n\u201cWell, Catnip, stealing\u2019s punishable by death, or hadn\u2019t you \n\nheard?\u201d he said. \n\u201cKatniss,\u201d I said louder. \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t stealing it. I just \n\nwanted to look at your snare. Mine never catch anything.\u201d \nHe scowled at me, not convinced. \u201cSo where\u2019d you get the \n\nsquirrel?\u201d \n\u201cI shot it.\u201d I pulled my bow off my shoulder. I was still using \n\nthe small version my father had made me, but I\u2019d been practic-\ning with the full-size one when I could. I was hoping that by \nspring I might be able to bring down some bigger game. \n\nGale\u2019s eyes fastened on the bow. \u201cCan I see that?\u201d I handed \nit over. \u201cJust remember, stealing\u2019s punishable by death.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n111 \n \n\nThat was the first time I ever saw him smile. It transformed \nhim from someone menacing to someone you wished you \nknew. But it took several months before I returned that smile. \n\nWe talked hunting then. I told him I might be able to get \nhim a bow if he had something to trade. Not food. I wanted \nknowledge. I wanted to set my own snares that caught a belt \nof fat rabbits in one day. He agreed something might be \nworked out. As the seasons went by, we grudgingly began to \nshare our knowledge, our weapons, our secret places that \nwere thick with wild plums or turkeys. He taught me snares \nand fishing. I showed him what plants to eat and eventually \ngave him one of our precious bows. And then one day, without \neither of us saying it, we became a team. Dividing the work \nand the spoils. Making sure that both our families had food. \n\nGale gave me a sense of security I\u2019d lacked since my father\u2019s \ndeath. His companionship replaced the long solitary hours in \nthe woods. I became a much better hunter when I didn\u2019t have \nto look over my shoulder constantly, when someone was \nwatching my back. But he turned into so much more than a \nhunting partner. He became my confidante, someone with \nwhom I could share thoughts I could never voice inside the \nfence. In exchange, he trusted me with his. Being out in the \nwoods with Gale . . . sometimes I was actually happy. \n\nI call him my friend, but in the last year it\u2019s seemed too ca-\nsual a word for what Gale is to me. A pang of longing shoots \nthrough my chest. If only he was with me now! But, of course, \nI don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want him in the arena where he\u2019d be \n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\ndead in a few days. I just . . . I just miss him. And I hate being \nso alone. Does he miss me? He must. \n\nI think of the eleven flashing under my name last night. I \nknow exactly what he\u2019d say to me. \u201cWell, there\u2019s some room \nfor improvement there.\u201d And then he\u2019d give me a smile and I\u2019d \nreturn it without hesitating now. \n\nI can\u2019t help comparing what I have with Gale to what I\u2019m \npretending to have with Peeta. How I never question Gale\u2019s \nmotives while I do nothing but doubt the latter\u2019s. It\u2019s not a fair \ncomparison really. Gale and I were thrown together by a mu-\ntual need to survive. Peeta and I know the other\u2019s survival \nmeans our own death. How do you sidestep that? \n\nEffie\u2019s knocking at the door, reminding me there\u2019s another \n\u201cbig, big, big day!\u201d ahead. Tomorrow night will be our tele-\nvised interviews. I guess the whole team will have their hands \nfull readying us for that. \n\nI get up and take a quick shower, being a bit more careful \nabout the buttons I hit, and head down to the dining room. \nPeeta, Effie, and Haymitch are huddled around the table talk-\ning in hushed voices. That seems odd, but hunger wins out \nover curiosity and I load up my plate with breakfast before I \njoin them. \n\nThe stew\u2019s made with tender chunks of lamb and dried \nplums today. Perfect on the bed of wild rice. I\u2019ve shoveled \nabout halfway through the mound when I realize no one\u2019s \ntalking. I take a big gulp of orange juice and wipe my mouth. \n\u201cSo, what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re coaching us on interviews today, \nright?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n113 \n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to wait until I\u2019m done. I can listen and cat \n\nat the same time,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWell, there\u2019s been a change of plans. About our current \n\napproach,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m not sure what our current ap-\n\nproach is. Trying to appear mediocre in front of the other tri-\nbutes is the last bit of strategy I remember. \n\nHaymitch shrugs. \u201cPeeta has asked to be coached separate-\nly.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n114 \n \n\n \n \n \nBetrayal. That\u2019s the first thing I feel, which is ludicrous. For \n\nthere to be betrayal, there would have had to been trust first. \nBetween Peeta and me. And trust has not been part of the \nagreement. We\u2019re tributes. But the boy who risked a beating \nto give me bread, the one who steadied me in the chariot, who \ncovered for me with the redheaded Avox girl, who insisted \nHaymitch know my hunting skills . . . was there some part of \nme that couldn\u2019t help trusting him? \n\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m relieved that we can stop the pre-\ntense of being friends. Obviously, whatever thin connection \nwe\u2019d foolishly formed has been severed. And high time, too. \nThe Games begin in two days, and trust will only be a weak-\nness. Whatever triggered Peeta\u2019s decision \u2014 and I suspect it \nhad to do with my outperforming him in training \u2014 I should \nbe nothing but grateful for it. Maybe he\u2019s finally accepted the \nfact that the sooner we openly acknowledge that we are ene-\nmies, the better. \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cSo what\u2019s the schedule?\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ll each have four hours with Effie for presentation and \n\nfour with me for content,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cYou start with Ef-\nfie, Katniss.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n115 \n \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what Effie will have to teach me that could \ntake four hours, but she\u2019s got me working down to the last \nminute. We go to my rooms and she puts me in a full-length \ngown and high-heeled shoes, not the ones I\u2019ll he wearing for \nthe actual interview, and instructs me on walking. The shoes \nare the worst part. I\u2019ve never worn high heels and can\u2019t get \nused to essentially wobbling around on the balls of my feet. \nBut Effie runs around in them full-time, and I\u2019m determined \nthat if she can do it, so can I. The dress poses another problem. \nIt keeps tangling around my shoes so, of course, I hitch it up, \nand then Effie swoops down on me like a hawk, smacking my \nhands and yelling, \u201cNot above the ankle!\u201d When I finally con-\nquer walking, there\u2019s still sitting, posture \u2014 apparently I have \na tendency to duck my head \u2014 eye contact, hand gestures, and \nsmiling. Smiling is mostly about smiling more. Effie makes me \nsay a hundred banal phrases starting with a smile, while smil-\ning, or ending with a smile. By lunch, the muscles in my cheeks \nare twitching from overuse. \n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s the best I can do,\u201d Effie says with a sigh. \u201cJust \nremember, Katniss, you want the audience to like you.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think they will?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNot if you glare at them the entire time. Why don\u2019t you \n\nsave that for the arena? Instead, think of yourself among \nfriends,\u201d says Effie. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re betting on how long I\u2019ll live!\u201d I burst out. \u201cThey\u2019re \nnot my friends!\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n116 \n \n\n\u201cWell, try and pretend!\u201d snaps Effie. Then she composes \nherself and beams at me. \u201cSee, like this. I\u2019m smiling at you \neven though you\u2019re aggravating me.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, it feels very convincing,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m going to eat.\u201d 1 \nkick off my heels and stomp down to the dining room, hiking \nmy skirt up to my thighs. \n\nPeeta and Haymitch seem in pretty good moods, so I\u2019m \nthinking the content session should be an improvement over \nthe morning. I couldn\u2019t be more wrong. After lunch, Haymitch \ntakes me into the sitting room, directs me to the couch, and \nthen just frowns at me for a while. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I finally ask. \n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what to do with you,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cHow we\u2019re going to present you. Are you going to be charm-\ning? Aloof? Fierce? So far, you\u2019re shining like a star. You volun-\nteered to save your sister. Cinna made you look unforgettable. \nYou\u2019ve got the top training score. People are intrigued, but no \none knows who you are. The impression you make tomorrow \nwill decide exactly what I can get you in terms of sponsors,\u201d \nsays Haymitch. \n\nHaving watched the tribute interviews all my life, I know \nthere\u2019s truth to what he\u2019s saying. If you appeal to the crowd, \neither by being humorous or brutal or eccentric, you gain fa-\nvor. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Peeta\u2019s approach? Or am I not allowed to ask?\u201d I \nsay. \n\n\n\n \n\n117 \n \n\n\u201cLikable. He has a sort of self-deprecating humor naturally,\u201d \nsays Haymitch. \u201cWhereas when you open your mouth, you \ncome across more as sullen and hostile.\u201d \n\n\u201cI do not!\u201d I say. \n\u201cPlease. I don\u2019t know where you pulled that cheery, wavy \n\ngirl on the chariot from, but I haven\u2019t seen her before or \nsince,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ve given me so many reasons to be cheery,\u201d I \ncounter. \n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to please me. I\u2019m not going to sponsor \nyou. So pretend I\u2019m the audience,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cDelight \nme.\u201d \n\n\u201cFine!\u201d I snarl. Haymitch takes the role of the interviewer \nand I try to answer his questions in a winning fashion. But I \ncan\u2019t. I\u2019m too angry with Haymitch for what he said and that I \neven have to answer the questions. All I can think is how un-\njust the whole thing is, the Hunger Games. Why am I hopping \naround like some trained dog trying to please people I hate? \nThe longer the interview goes on, the more my fury seems to \nrise to the surface, until I\u2019m literally spitting out answers at \nhim. \n\n\u201cAll right, enough,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find another an-\ngle. Not only are you hostile, I don\u2019t know anything about you. \nI\u2019ve asked you fifty questions and still have no sense of your \nlife, your family, what you care about. They want to know \nabout you, Katniss.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n118 \n \n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t want them to! They\u2019re already taking my fu-\nture! They can\u2019t have the things that mattered to me in the \npast!\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cThen lie! Make something up!\u201d says Haymitch. \n\u201cI\u2019m not good at lying,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWell, you better learn fast. You\u2019ve got about as much \n\ncharm as a dead slug,\u201d says Haymitch. \nOuch. That hurts. Even Haymitch must know he\u2019s been too \n\nharsh because his voice softens. \u201cHere\u2019s an idea. Try acting \nhumble.\u201d \n\n\u201cHumble,\u201d I echo. \n\u201cThat you can\u2019t believe a little girl from District Twelve has \n\ndone this well. The whole thing\u2019s been more than you ever \ncould have dreamed of. Talk about Cinna\u2019s clothes. How nice \nthe people are. How the city amazes you. If you won\u2019t talk \nabout yourself, at least compliment the audience. Just keep \nturning it back around, all right. Gush.\u201d \n\nThe next hours are agonizing. At once, it\u2019s clear I cannot \ngush. We try me playing cocky, but I just don\u2019t have the arrog-\nance. Apparently, I\u2019m too \u201cvulnerable\u201d for ferocity. I\u2019m not wit-\nty. Funny. Sexy. Or mysterious. \n\nBy the end of the session, I am no one at all. Haymitch \nstarted drinking somewhere around witty, and a nasty edge \nhas crept into his voice. \u201cI give up, sweetheart. Just answer the \nquestions and try not to let the audience see how openly you \ndespise them.\u201d \n\nI have dinner that night in my room, ordering an outra-\ngeous number of delicacies, eating myself sick, and then tak-\n\n\n\n \n\n119 \n \n\ning out my anger at Haymitch, at the Hunger Games, at every \nliving being in the Capitol by smashing dishes around my \nroom. When the girl with the red hair comes in to turn down \nmy bed, her eyes widen at the mess. \u201cJust leave it!\u201d I yell at \nher. \u201cJust leave it alone!\u201d \n\nI hate her, too, with her knowing reproachful eyes that call \nme a coward, a monster, a puppet of the Capitol, both now and \nthen. For her, justice must finally be happening. At least my \ndeath will help pay for the life of the boy in the woods. \n\nBut instead of fleeing the room, the girl closes the door be-\nhind her and goes to the bathroom. She comes back with a \ndamp cloth and wipes my face gently then cleans the blood \nfrom a broken plate off my hands. Why is she doing this? Why \nam I letting her? \n\n\u201cI should have tried to save you,\u201d I whisper. \nShe shakes her head. Does this mean we were right to stand \n\nby? That she has forgiven me? \n\u201cNo, it was wrong,\u201d I say. \nShe taps her lips with her fingers then points to my chest. I \n\nthink she means that I would just have ended up an Avox, too. \nProbably would have. An Avox or dead. \n\nI spend the next hour helping the redheaded girl clean the \nroom. When all the garbage has been dropped down a dispos-\nal and the food cleaned away, she turns down my bed. I crawl \nin between the sheets like a five-year-old and let her tuck me \nin. Then she goes. I want her to stay until I fall asleep. To be \nthere when I wake up. I want the protection of this girl, even \nthough she never had mine. \n\n\n\n \n\n120 \n \n\nIn the morning, it\u2019s not the girl but my prep team who are \nhanging over me. My lessons with Effie and Haymitch are \nover. This day belongs to Cinna. He\u2019s my last hope. Maybe he \ncan make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes \nout of my mouth. \n\nThe team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin \nto glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting \nflame designs on my twenty perfect nails. Then Venia goes to \nwork on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that \nbegins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in \none braid down my right shoulder. They erase my face with a \nlayer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. Huge \ndark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when \nI blink. Finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that \nmakes me shimmer in gold dust. \n\nThen Cinna enters with what I assume is my dress, but I \ncan\u2019t really see it because it\u2019s covered. \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he \norders. \n\nI can feel the silken inside as they slip it down over my \nnaked body, then the weight. It must be forty pounds. I clutch \nOctavia\u2019s hand as I blindly step into my shoes, glad to find \nthey are at least two inches lower than the pair Effie had me \npractice in. There\u2019s some adjusting and fidgeting. Then si-\nlence. \n\n\u201cCan I open my eyes?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cYes,\u201d says Cinna. \u201cOpen them.\u201d \nThe creature standing before me in the full-length mirror \n\nhas come from another world. Where skin shimmers and eyes \n\n\n\n \n\n121 \n \n\nflash and apparently they make their clothes from jewels. Be-\ncause my dress, oh, my dress is entirely covered in reflective \nprecious gems, red and yellow and white with bits of blue that \naccent the tips of the flame design. The slightest movement \ngives the impression I am engulfed in tongues of fire. \n\nI am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the \nsun. \n\nFor a while, we all just stare at me. \u201cOh, Cinna,\u201d I finally \nwhisper. \u201cThank you.\u201d \n\n\u201cTwirl for me,\u201d he says. I hold out my arms and spin in a \ncircle. The prep team screams in admiration. \n\nCinna dismisses the team and has me move around in the \ndress and shoes, which are infinitely more manageable than \nEffie\u2019s. The dress hangs in such a way that I don\u2019t have to lift \nthe skirt when I walk, leaving me with one less thing to worry \nabout. \n\n\u201cSo, all ready for the interview then?\u201d asks Cinna. I can see \nby his expression that he\u2019s been talking to Haymitch. That he \nknows how dreadful I am. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m awful. Haymitch called me a dead slug. No matter what \nwe tried, I couldn\u2019t do it. I just can\u2019t be one of those people he \nwants me to be,\u201d I say. \n\nCinna thinks about this a moment. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just be \nyourself?\u201d \n\n\u201cMyself? That\u2019s no good, either. Haymitch says I\u2019m sullen \nand hostile,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cWell, you are . . . around Haymitch,\u201d says Cinna with a grin. \n\u201cI don\u2019t find you so. The prep team adores you. You even won \n\n\n\n \n\n122 \n \n\nover the Gamemakers. And as for the citizens of the Capitol, \nwell, they can\u2019t stop talking about you. No one can help but \nadmire your spirit.\u201d \n\nMy spirit. This is a new thought. I\u2019m not sure exactly what it \nmeans, but it suggests I\u2019m a fighter. In a sort of brave way. It\u2019s \nnot as if I\u2019m never friendly. Okay, maybe I don\u2019t go around lov-\ning everybody I meet, maybe my smiles are hard to come by, \nbut I do care for some people. \n\nCinna takes my icy hands in his warm ones. \u201cSuppose, when \nyou answer the questions, you think you\u2019re addressing a \nfriend back home. Who would your best friend be?\u201d asks Cin-\nna. \n\n\u201cGale,\u201d I say instantly. \u201cOnly it doesn\u2019t make sense, Cinna. I \nwould never be telling Gale those things about me. He already \nknows them.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat about me? Could you think of me as a friend?\u201d asks \nCinna. \n\nOf all the people I\u2019ve met since I left home, Cinna is by far \nmy favorite. I liked him right off and he hasn\u2019t disappointed \nme yet. \u201cI think so, but \u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be sitting on the main platform with the other stylists. \nYou\u2019ll be able to look right at me. When you\u2019re asked a ques-\ntion, find me, and answer it as honestly as possible,\u201d says Cin-\nna. \n\n\u201cEven if what I think is horrible?\u201d I ask. Because it might be, \nreally. \n\n\u201cEspecially if what you think is horrible,\u201d says Cinna. \u201cYou\u2019ll \ntry it?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n123 \n \n\nI nod. It\u2019s a plan. Or at least a straw to grasp at. \nToo soon it\u2019s time to go. The interviews take place on a \n\nstage constructed in front of the Training Center. Once I leave \nmy room, it will be only minutes until I\u2019m in front of the \ncrowd, the cameras, all of Panem. \n\nAs Cinna turns the doorknob, I stop his hand. \u201cCinna . . .\u201d I\u2019m \ncompletely overcome with stage fright. \n\n\u201cRemember, they already love you,\u201d he says gently. \u201cJust be \nyourself.\u201d \n\nWe meet up with the rest of the District 12 crowd at the \nelevator. Portia and her gang have been hard at work. Peeta \nlooks striking in a black suit with flame accents. While we look \nwell together, it\u2019s a relief not to be dressed identically. Hay-\nmitch and Effie are all fancied up for the occasion. I avoid \nHaymitch, but accept Effie\u2019s compliments. Effie can be tire-\nsome and clueless, but she\u2019s not destructive like Haymitch. \n\nWhen the elevator opens, the other tributes are being lined \nup to take the stage. All twenty-four of us sit in a big arc \nthroughout the interviews. I\u2019ll be last, or second to last since \nthe girl tribute precedes the boy from each district. How I \nwish I could be first and get the whole thing out of the way! \nNow I\u2019ll have to listen to how witty, funny, humble, fierce, and \ncharming everybody else is before I go up. Plus, the audience \nwill start to get bored, just as the Gamemakers did. And I can\u2019t \nexactly shoot an arrow into the crowd to get their attention. \n\nRight before we parade onto the stage, Haymitch comes up \nbehind Peeta and me and growls, \u201cRemember, you\u2019re still a \nhappy pair. So act like it.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n124 \n \n\nWhat? I thought we abandoned that when Peeta asked for \nseparate coaching. But I guess that was a private, not a public \nthing. Anyway, there\u2019s not much chance for interaction now, \nas we walk single-file to our seats and take our places. \n\nJust stepping on the stage makes my breathing rapid and \nshallow. I can feel my pulse pounding in my temples. It\u2019s a re-\nlief to get to my chair, because between the heels and my legs \nshaking, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll trip. Although evening is falling, the City \nCircle is brighter than a summer\u2019s day. An elevated seating \nunit has been set up for prestigious guests, with the stylists \ncommanding the front row. The cameras will turn to them \nwhen the crowd is reacting to their handiwork. A large balco-\nny off a building to the right has been reserved for the Game-\nmakers. Television crews have claimed most of the other bal-\nconies. But the City Circle and the avenues that feed into it are \ncompletely packed with people. Standing room only. At homes \nand community halls around the country, every television set \nis turned on. Every citizen of Panem is tuned in. There will be \nno blackouts tonight. \n\nCaesar Flickerman, the man who has hosted the interviews \nfor more than forty years, bounces onto the stage. It\u2019s a little \nscary because his appearance has been virtually unchanged \nduring all that time. Same face under a coating of pure white \nmakeup. Same hairstyle that he dyes a different color for each \nHunger Games. Same ceremonial suit, midnight blue dotted \nwith a thousand tiny electric bulbs that twinkle like stars. \nThey do surgery in the Capitol, to make people appear young-\ner and thinner. In District 12, looking old is something of an \n\n\n\n \n\n125 \n \n\nachievement since so many people die early. You see an elder-\nly person you want to congratulate them on their longevity, \nask the secret of survival. A plump person is envied because \nthey aren\u2019t scraping by like the majority of us. But here it is \ndifferent. Wrinkles aren\u2019t desirable. A round belly isn\u2019t a sign \nof success. \n\nThis year, Caesar\u2019s hair is powder blue and his eyelids and \nlips are coated in the same hue. He looks freakish but less \nfrightening than he did last year when his color was crimson \nand he seemed to be bleeding. Caesar tells a few jokes to \nwarm up the audience but then gets down to business. \n\nThe girl tribute from District 1, looking provocative in a \nsee-through gold gown, steps up the center of the stage to join \nCaesar for her interview. You can tell her mentor didn\u2019t have \nany trouble coming up with an angle for her. With that flowing \nblonde hair, emerald green eyes, her body tall and lush . . . \nshe\u2019s sexy all the way. \n\nEach interview only lasts three minutes. Then a buzzer \ngoes off and the next tribute is up. I\u2019ll say this for Caesar, he \nreally does his best to make the tributes shine. He\u2019s friendly, \ntries to set the nervous ones at ease, laughs at lame jokes, and \ncan turn a weak response into a memorable one by the way he \nreacts. \n\nI sit like a lady, the way Effie showed me, as the districts \nslip by. 2, 3, 4. Everyone seems to be playing up some angle. \nThe monstrous boy from District 2 is a ruthless killing ma-\nchine. The fox-faced girl from District 5 sly and elusive. I spot-\nted Cinna as soon as he took his place, but even his presence \n\n\n\n \n\n126 \n \n\ncannot relax me. 8, 9, 10. The crippled boy from 10 is very \nquiet. My palms are sweating like crazy, but the jeweled dress \nisn\u2019t absorbent and they skid right of if I try to dry them. 11. \n\nRue, who is dressed in a gossamer gown complete with \nwings, flutters her way to Caesar. A hush falls over the crowd \nat the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. Caesar\u2019s very \nsweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excel-\nlent score for one so small. When he asks her what her great-\nest strength in the arena will be, she doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI\u2019m \nvery hard to catch,\u201d she says in a tremulous voice. \u201cAnd if they \ncan\u2019t catch me, they can\u2019t kill me. So don\u2019t count me out.\u201d \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t in a million years,\u201d says Caesar encouragingly. \nThe boy tribute from District 11, Thresh, has the same dark \n\nskin as Rue, but the resemblance stops there. He\u2019s one of the \ngiants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but \nI noticed he rejected the invitations from the Career Tributes \nto join their crowd. Instead he\u2019s been very solitary, speaking \nto no one, showing little interest in training. Even so, he \nscored a ten and it\u2019s not hard to imagine he impressed the \nGamemakers. He ignores Caesar\u2019s attempts at banter and an-\nswers with a yes or no or just remains silent. \n\nIf only I was his size, I could get away with sullen and hos-\ntile and it would be just fine! I bet half the sponsors are at \nleast considering him. If I had any money, I\u2019d bet on him my-\nself. \n\nAnd then they\u2019re calling Katniss Everdeen, and I feel myself, \nas if in a dream, standing and making my way center stage. I \n\n\n\n \n\n127 \n \n\nshake Caesar\u2019s outstretched hand, and he has the good grace \nnot to immediately wipe his off on his suit. \n\n\u201cSo, Katniss, the Capitol must be quite a change from Dis-\ntrict Twelve. What\u2019s impressed you most since you arrived \nhere?\u201d asks Caesar. \n\nWhat? What did he say? It\u2019s as if the words make no sense. \nMy mouth has gone as dry as sawdust. I desperately find \n\nCinna in the crowd and lock eyes with him. I imagine the \nwords coming from his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s impressed you most since \nyou arrived here?\u201d I rack my brain for something that made \nme happy here. Be honest, I think. Be honest. \n\n\u201cThe lamb stew,\u201d I get out. \nCaesar laughs, and vaguely I realize some of the audience \n\nhas joined in. \n\u201cThe one with the dried plums?\u201d asks Caesar. I nod. \u201cOh, I \n\neat it by the bucketful.\u201d He turns sideways to the audience in \nhorror, hand on his stomach. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t show, does it?\u201d They \nshout reassurances to him and applaud. This is what I mean \nabout Caesar. He tries to help you out. \n\n\u201cNow, Katniss,\u201d he says confidentially, \u201cWhen you came out \nin the opening ceremonies, my heart actually stopped. What \ndid you think of that costume?\u201d \n\nCinna raises one eyebrow at me. Be honest. \u201cYou mean af-\nter I got over my fear of being burned alive?\u201d I ask. \n\nBig laugh. A real one from the audience. \n\u201cYes. Start then,\u201d says Caesar. \nCinna, my friend, I should tell him anyway. \u201cI thought Cinna \n\nwas brilliant and it was the most gorgeous costume I\u2019d ever \n\n\n\n \n\n128 \n \n\nseen and I couldn\u2019t believe I was wearing it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m \nwearing this, either.\u201d I lift up my skirt to spread it out. \u201cI mean, \nlook at it!\u201d \n\nAs the audience oohs and ahs, I see Cinna make the tiniest \ncircular motion with his finger. But I know what he\u2019s saying. \nTwirl for me. \n\nI spin in a circle once and the reaction is immediate. \n\u201cOh, do that again!\u201d says Caesar, and so I lift up my arms \n\nand spin around and around letting the skirt fly out, letting \nthe dress engulf me in flames. The audience breaks into \ncheers. When I stop, I clutch Caesar\u2019s arm. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d he says. \n\u201cI have to, I\u2019m dizzy!\u201d I\u2019m also giggling, which I think I\u2019ve \n\ndone maybe never in my lifetime. But the nerves and the \nspinning have gotten to me. \n\nCaesar wraps a protective arm around me. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, \nI\u2019ve got you. Can\u2019t have you following in your mentor\u2019s foot-\nsteps.\u201d \n\nEveryone\u2019s hooting as the cameras find Haymitch, who is \nby now famous for his head dive at the reaping, and he waves \nthem away good-naturedly and points back to me. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Caesar reassures the crowd. \u201cShe\u2019s safe with \nme. So, how about that training score. E-le-ven. Give us a hint \nwhat happened in there.\u201d \n\nI glance at the Gamemakers on the balcony and bite my lip. \n\u201cUm . . . all I can say, is I think it was a first.\u201d \n\nThe cameras are right on the Gamemakers, who are chuck-\nling and nodding. \n\n\n\n \n\n129 \n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing us,\u201d says Caesar as if in actual pain. \u201cDetails. \nDetails.\u201d \n\nI address the balcony. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to talk about it, \nright?\u201d \n\nThe Gamemaker who fell in the punch bowl shouts out, \n\u201cShe\u2019s not!\u201d \n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cSorry. My lips are sealed.\u201d \n\u201cLet\u2019s go back then, to the moment they called your sister\u2019s \n\nname at the reaping,\u201d says Caesar. His mood is quieter now. \n\u201cAnd you volunteered. Can you tell us about her?\u201d \n\nNo. No, not all of you. But maybe Cinna. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m \nimagining the sadness on his face. \u201cHer name\u2019s Prim. She\u2019s just \ntwelve. And I love her more than anything.\u201d \n\nYou could hear a pin drop in the City Circle now. \n\u201cWhat did she say to you? After the reaping?\u201d Caesar asks. \nBe honest. Be honest. I swallow hard. \u201cShe asked me to try \n\nreally hard to win.\u201d The audience is frozen, hanging on my \nevery word. \n\n\u201cAnd what did you say?\u201d prompts Caesar gently. \nBut instead of warmth, I feel an icy rigidity take over my \n\nbody. My muscles tense as they do before a kill. When I speak, \nmy voice seems to have dropped an octave. \u201cI swore I would.\u201d \n\n\u201cI bet you did,\u201d says Caesar, giving me a squeeze. The buzz-\ner goes off. \u201cSorry we\u2019re out of time. Best of luck, Katniss \nEverdeen, tribute from District Twelve.\u201d \n\nThe applause continues long after I\u2019m seated. I look to Cin-\nna for reassurance. He gives me a subtle thumbs-up. \n\n\n\n \n\n130 \n \n\nI\u2019m still in a daze for the first part of Peeta\u2019s interview. He \nhas the audience from the get-go, though; I can hear them \nlaughing, shouting out. He plays up the baker\u2019s son thing, \ncomparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. Then \nhas a funny anecdote about the perils of the Capitol showers. \n\u201cTell me, do I still smell like roses?\u201d he asks Caesar, and then \nthere\u2019s a whole run where they take turns sniffing each other \nthat brings down the house. I\u2019m coming back into focus when \nCaesar asks him if he has a girlfriend back home. \n\nPeeta hesitates, then gives an unconvincing shake of his \nhead. \n\n\u201cHandsome lad like you. There must be some special girl. \nCome on, what\u2019s her name?\u201d says Caesar. \n\nPeeta sighs. \u201cWell, there is this one girl. I\u2019ve had a crush on \nher ever since I can remember. But I\u2019m pretty sure she didn\u2019t \nknow I was alive until the reaping.\u201d \n\nSounds of sympathy from the crowd. Unrequited love they \ncan relate to. \n\n\u201cShe have another fellow?\u201d asks Caesar. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but a lot of boys like her,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cSo, here\u2019s what you do. You win, you go home. She can\u2019t \n\nturn you down then, eh?\u201d says Caesar encouragingly. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work out. Winning . . . won\u2019t help \n\nin my case,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cWhy ever not?\u201d says Caesar, mystified. \nPeeta blushes beet red and stammers out. \u201cBecause . . . be-\n\ncause . . . she came here with me.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n131 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPART II \n\"THE GAMES\" \n\n\n\n \n\n132 \n \n\n \n \n \nFor a moment, the cameras hold on Peeta\u2019s downcast eyes \n\nas what he says sinks in. Then I can see my face, mouth half \nopen in a mix of surprise and protest, magnified on every \nscreen as I realize, Me! He means me! I press my lips together \nand stare at the floor, hoping this will conceal the emotions \nstarting to boil up inside of me. \n\n\u201cOh, that is a piece of bad luck,\u201d says Caesar, and there\u2019s a \nreal edge of pain in his voice. The crowd is murmuring in \nagreement, a few have even given agonized cries. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d agrees Peeta. \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think any of us can blame you. It\u2019d be hard not \n\nto fall for that young lady,\u201d says Caesar. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know?\u201d \nPeeta shakes his head. \u201cNot until now.\u201d \nI allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to \n\nsee that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. \n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to pull her back out here and get a re-\n\nsponse?\u201d Caesar asks the audience. The crowd screams assent. \n\u201cSadly, rules are rules, and Katniss Everdeen\u2019s time has been \nspent. Well, best of luck to you, Peeta Mellark, and I think I \nspeak for all of Panem when I say our hearts go with yours.\u201d \n\nThe roar of the crowd is deafening. Peeta has absolutely \nwiped the rest of us off the map with his declaration of love \n\n\n\n \n\n133 \n \n\nfor me. When the audience finally settles down, he chokes out \na quiet \u201cThank you\u201d and returns to his seat. We stand for the \nanthem. I have to raise my head out of the required respect \nand cannot avoid seeing that every screen is now dominated \nby a shot of Peeta and me, separated by a few feet that in the \nviewers\u2019 heads can never be breached. Poor tragic us. \n\nBut I know better. \nAfter the anthem, the tributes file back into the Training \n\nCenter lobby and onto the elevators. I make sure to veer into a \ncar that does not contain Peeta. The crowd slows our entou-\nrages of stylists and mentors and chaperones, so we have only \neach other for company. No one speaks. My elevator stops to \ndeposit four tributes before I am alone and then find the doors \nopening on the twelfth floor. Peeta has only just stepped from \nhis car when I slam my palms into his chest. He loses his bal-\nance and crashes into an ugly urn filled with fake flowers. The \nurn tips and shatters into hundreds of tiny pieces. Peeta lands \nin the shards, and blood immediately flows from his hands. \n\n\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he says, aghast. \n\u201cYou had no right! No right to go saying those things about \n\nme!\u201d I shout at him. \nNow the elevators open and the whole crew is there, Effie, \n\nHaymitch, Cinna, and Portia. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d says Effie, a note of hysteria in her \n\nvoice. \u201cDid you fall?\u201d \n\u201cAfter she shoved me,\u201d says Peeta as Effie and Cinna help \n\nhim up. \nHaymitch turns on me. \u201cShoved him?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n134 \n \n\n\u201cThis was your idea, wasn\u2019t it? Turning me into some kind \nof fool in front of the entire country?\u201d I answer. \n\n\u201cIt was my idea,\u201d says Peeta, wincing as he pulls spikes of \npottery from his palms. \u201cHaymitch just helped me with it.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, Haymitch is very helpful. To you!\u201d I say. \n\u201cYou are a fool,\u201d Haymitch says in disgust. \u201cDo you think he \n\nhurt you? That boy just gave you something you could never \nachieve on your own.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe made me look weak!\u201d I say. \n\u201cHe made you look desirable! And let\u2019s face it, you can use \n\nall the help you can get in that department. You were about as \nromantic as dirt until he said he wanted you. Now they all do. \nYou\u2019re all they\u2019re talking about. The star-crossed lovers from \nDistrict Twelve!\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not star-crossed lovers!\u201d I say. \nHaymitch grabs my shoulders and pins me against the wall. \n\n\u201cWho cares? It\u2019s all a big show. It\u2019s all how you\u2019re perceived. \nThe most I could say about you after your interview was that \nyou were nice enough, although that in itself was a small mi-\nracle. Now I can say you\u2019re a heartbreaker. Oh, oh, oh, how the \nboys back home fall longingly at your feet. Which do you think \nwill get you more sponsors?\u201d \n\nThe smell of wine on his breath makes me sick. I shove his \nhands off my shoulders and step away, trying to clear my \nhead. \n\nCinna comes over and puts his arm around me. \u201cHe\u2019s right, \nKatniss.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n135 \n \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think. \u201cI should have been told, so I \ndidn\u2019t look so stupid.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, your reaction was perfect. If you\u2019d known, it wouldn\u2019t \nhave read as real,\u201d says Portia. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just worried about her boyfriend,\u201d says Peeta gruffly, \ntossing away a bloody piece of the urn. \n\nMy cheeks burn again at the thought of Gale. \u201cI don\u2019t have a \nboyfriend.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhatever,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cBut I bet he\u2019s smart enough to \nknow a bluff when he sees it. Besides you didn\u2019t say you loved \nme. So what does it matter?\u201d \n\nThe words are sinking in. My anger fading. I\u2019m torn now be-\ntween thinking I\u2019ve been used and thinking I\u2019ve been given an \nedge. Haymitch is right. I survived my interview, but what was \nI really? A silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. Giggling. The \nonly moment of any substance I hail was when I talked about \nPrim. Compare that with Thresh, his silent, deadly power, and \nI\u2019m forgettable. Silly and sparkly and forgettable. No, not en-\ntirely forgettable, I have my eleven in training. \n\nBut now Peeta has made me an object of love. Not just his. \nTo hear him tell it I have many admirers. And if the audience \nreally thinks we\u2019re in love . . . I remember how strongly they \nresponded to his confession. Star-crossed lovers. Haymitch is \nright, they eat that stuff up in the Capitol. Suddenly I\u2019m wor-\nried that I didn\u2019t react properly. \n\n\u201cAfter he said he loved me, did you think I could be in love \nwith him, too?\u201d I ask. \n\n\n\n \n\n136 \n \n\n\u201cI did,\u201d says Portia. \u201cThe way you avoided looking at the \ncameras, the blush.\u201d \n\nThey others chime in, agreeing. \n\u201cYou\u2019re golden, sweetheart. You\u2019re going to have sponsors \n\nlined up around the block,\u201d says Haymitch. \nI\u2019m embarrassed about my reaction. I force myself to ac-\n\nknowledge Peeta. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I shoved you.\u201d \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s technically illeg-\n\nal.\u201d \n\u201cAre your hands okay?\u201d I ask. \u201cThey\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he says. \nIn the silence that follows, delicious smells of our dinner \n\nwaft in from the dining room. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s eat,\u201d says Hay-\nmitch. We all follow him to the table and take our places. But \nthen Peeta is bleeding too heavily, and Portia leads him off for \nmedical treatment. We start the cream and rose-petal soup \nwithout them. By the time we\u2019ve finished, they\u2019re back. Peeta\u2019s \nhands are wrapped in bandages. I can\u2019t help feeling guilty. \nTomorrow we will be in the arena. He has done me a favor \nand I have answered with an injury. Will I never stop owing \nhim? \n\nAfter dinner, we watch the replay in the sitting room. I \nseem frilly and shallow, twirling and giggling in my dress, al-\nthough the others assure me I am charming. Peeta actually is \ncharming and then utterly winning as the boy in love. And \nthere I am, blushing and confused, made beautiful by Cinna\u2019s \nhands, desirable by Peeta\u2019s confession, tragic by circumstance, \nand by all accounts, unforgettable. \n\n\n\n \n\n137 \n \n\nWhen the anthem finishes and the screen goes dark, a hush \nfalls on the room. Tomorrow at dawn, we will be roused and \nprepared for the arena. The actual Games don\u2019t start until ten \nbecause so many of the Capitol residents rise late. But Peeta \nand I must make an early start. There is no telling how far we \nwill travel to the arena that has been prepared for this year\u2019s \nGames. \n\nI know Haymitch and Effie will not be going with us. As \nsoon as they leave here, they\u2019ll be at the Games Headquarters, \nhopefully madly signing up our sponsors, working out a strat-\negy on how and when to deliver the gifts to us. Cinna and Por-\ntia will travel with us to the very spot from which we will be \nlaunched into the arena. Still final good-byes must be said \nhere. \n\nEffie takes both of us by the hand and, with actual tears in \nher eyes, wishes us well. Thanks us for being the best tributes \nit has ever been her privilege to sponsor. And then, because \nit\u2019s Effie and she\u2019s apparently required by law to say some-\nthing awful, she adds \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if I finally \nget promoted to a decent district next year!\u201d \n\nThen she kisses us each on the cheek and hurries out, over-\ncome with either the emotional parting or the possible im-\nprovement of her fortunes. \n\nHaymitch crosses his arms and looks us both over. \n\u201cAny final words of advice?\u201d asks Peeta. \n\u201cWhen the gong sounds, get the hell out of there. You\u2019re \n\nneither of you up to the blood bath at the Cornucopia. Just \n\n\n\n \n\n138 \n \n\nclear out, put as much distance as you can between yourselves \nand the others, and find a source of water,\u201d he says. \u201cGot it?\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd after that?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cStay alive,\u201d says Haymitch. It\u2019s the same advice he gave us \n\non the train, but he\u2019s not drunk and laughing this time. And we \nonly nod. What else is there to say? \n\nWhen I head to my room, Peeta lingers to talk to Portia. I\u2019m \nglad. Whatever strange words of parting we exchange can \nwait until tomorrow. My covers are drawn back, but there is \nno sign of the redheaded Avox girl. I wish I knew her name. I \nshould have asked it. She could write it down maybe. Or act it \nout. But perhaps that would only result in punishment for her. \n\nI take a shower and scrub the gold paint, the makeup, the \nscent of beauty from my body. All that remains of the design-\nteam\u2019s efforts are the flames on my nails. I decide to keep \nthem as reminder of who I am to the audience. Katniss, the \ngirl who was on fire. Perhaps it will give me something to hold \non to in the days to come. \n\nI pull on a thick, fleecy nightgown and climb into bed. It \ntakes me about five seconds to realize I\u2019ll never fall asleep. \nAnd I need sleep desperately because in the arena every mo-\nment I give in to fatigue will be an invitation to death. \n\nIt\u2019s no good. One hour, two, three pass, and my eyelids \nrefuse to get heavy. I can\u2019t stop trying to imagine exactly what \nterrain I\u2019ll be thrown into. Desert? Swamp? A frigid wastel-\nand? Above all I am hoping for trees, which may afford me \nsome means of concealment and food and shelter, Often there \nare trees because barren landscapes are dull and the Games \n\n\n\n \n\n139 \n \n\nresolve too quickly without them. But what will the climate be \nlike? What traps have the Gamemakers hid den to liven up the \nslower moments? And then there are my fellow tributes . . . \n\nThe more anxious I am to find sleep, the more it eludes me. \nFinally, I am too restless to even stay in bed. I pace the floor, \nheart beating too fast, breathing too short. My room feels like \na prison cell. If I don\u2019t get air soon, I\u2019m going to start to throw \nthings again. I run down the hall to the door to the roof. It\u2019s \nnot only unlocked but ajar. Perhaps someone forgot to close it, \nbut it doesn\u2019t matter. The energy field enclosing the roof pre-\nvents any desperate form of escape. And I\u2019m not looking to es-\ncape, only to fill my lungs with air. I want to see the sky and \nthe moon on the last night that no one will be hunting me. \n\nThe roof is not lit at night, but as soon as my bare feel reach \nits tiled surface I see his silhouette, black against the lights \nthat shine endlessly in the Capitol. There\u2019s quite a commotion \ngoing on down in the streets, music and singing and car horns, \nnone of which I could hear through the thick glass window \npanels in my room. I could slip away now, without him notic-\ning me; he wouldn\u2019t hear me over the din, But the night air\u2019s \nso sweet, I can\u2019t bear returning to that stuffy cage of a room. \nAnd what difference does it make? Whether we speak or not? \n\nMy feet move soundlessly across the tiles. I\u2019m only yard be-\nhind him when I say, \u201cYou should be getting some sleep.\u201d \n\nHe starts but doesn\u2019t turn. I can see him give his head a \nslight shake. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to miss the party. It\u2019s for us, after \nall.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n140 \n \n\nI come up beside him and lean over the edge of the rail. The \nwide streets are full of dancing people. I squint to make out \ntheir tiny figures in more detail. \u201cAre they in costumes?\u201d \n\n\u201cWho could tell?\u201d Peeta answers. \u201cWith all the crazy clothes \nthey wear here. Couldn\u2019t sleep, either?\u201d \n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t turn my mind off,\u201d I say. \n\u201cThinking about your family?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cNo,\u201d I admit a bit guiltily. \u201cAll I can do is wonder about to-\n\nmorrow. Which is pointless, of course.\u201d In the light from be-\nlow, I can see his face now, the awkward way he holds his \nbandaged hands. \u201cI really am sorry about your hands.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Katniss,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a con-\ntender in these Games anyway.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no way to be thinking,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s true. My best hope is to not disgrace myself \n\nand . . .\u201d He hesitates. \n\u201cAnd what?\u201d I say. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to say it exactly. Only . . . I want to die as \n\nmyself. Does that make any sense?\u201d he asks. I shake my head. \nHow could he die as anyone but himself? \u201cI don\u2019t want them to \nchange me in there. Turn me into some kind of monster that \nI\u2019m not.\u201d \n\nI bite my lip feeling inferior. While I\u2019ve been ruminating on \nthe availability of trees, Peeta has been struggling with how to \nmaintain his identity. His purity of self. \u201cDo you mean you \nwon\u2019t kill anyone?\u201d I ask. \n\n \u201cNo, when the time comes, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll kill just like every-\nbody else. I can\u2019t go down without a fight. Only I keep wishing \n\n\n\n \n\n141 \n \n\nI could think of a way to . . . to show the Capitol they don\u2019t own \nme. That I\u2019m more than just a piece in their Games,\u201d says Pee-\nta. \n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re not,\u201d I say. \u201cNone of us are. That\u2019s how the \nGames work.\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay, but within that framework, there\u2019s still you, there\u2019s \nstill me,\u201d he insists. \u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d \n\n\u201cA little. Only . . . no offense, but who cares, Peeta?\u201d I say. \n\u201cI do. I mean, what else am I allowed to care about at this \n\npoint?\u201d he asks angrily. He\u2019s locked those blue eyes on mine \nnow, demanding an answer. \n\nI take a step back. \u201cCare about what Haymitch said. About \nstaying alive.\u201d \n\nPeeta smiles at me, sad and mocking. \u201cOkay. Thanks for the \ntip, sweetheart.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s like a slap in the face. His use of Haymitch\u2019s patronizing \nendearment. \u201cLook, if you want to spend the last hours of your \nlife planning some noble death in the arena, that\u2019s your choice. \nI want to spend mine in District Twelve.\u201d \n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t surprise me if you do,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cGive my \nmother my best when you make it back, will you?\u201d \n\n\u201cCount on it,\u201d I say. Then I turn and leave the roof. I spend \nthe rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining \nthe cutting remarks I will make to Peeta Mellark in the morn-\ning. Peeta Mellark. We will see how high and mighty he is \nwhen he's faced with life and death. He'll probably turn into \none of those raging beast tributes, the kind who tries to eat \nsomeone's heart after they've killed them. There was a guy \n\n\n\n \n\n142 \n \n\nlike that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went \ncompletely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him \nstunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players \nhe'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, \nbut cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, \nso they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that \nthe avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engi-\nneered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic. \n\nI don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me before \ndawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the \nroof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the \ncatacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of \nthin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the \nredheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I \nplace my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's \nas if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder \nwhile I'm lifted safely inside. \n\nI expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck \nwhen a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a sy-\nringe. \"This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you are, \nthe more efficiently I can place it,\" she says. \n\nStill? I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from feeling \nthe sharp stab of pain as the needle inserts the metal tracking \ndevice deep under the skin on the inside of my forearm. Now \nthe Gamemakers will always be able to trace my whereabouts \nin the arena. Wouldn\u2019t want to lose a tribute. \n\nAs soon as the tracker\u2019s in place, the ladder releases me. \nThe woman disappears and Cinna is retrieved from the roof, \n\n\n\n \n\n143 \n \n\nAn Avox boy comes in and directs us to a room where break-\nfast has been laid out. Despite the tension in my stomach, I eat \nas much as I can, although none of the delectable food makes \nany impression on me. I\u2019m so nervous, I could be eating coal \ndust. The one thing that distracts me at all is the view from the \nwindows as we sail over the city and then to the wilderness \nbeyond. This is what birds see. Only they\u2019re free and safe. The \nvery opposite of me. \n\nThe ride lasts about half an hour before the windows black \nout, suggesting that we\u2019re nearing the arena. The hovercraft \nlands and Cinna and I go back to the ladder, only this time it \nleads down into a tube underground, into the catacombs that \nlie beneath the arena. We follow instructions to my destina-\ntion, a chamber for my preparation. In the Capitol, they call it \nthe Launch Room. In the districts, it\u2019s referred to as the Stock-\nyard. The place animals go before slaughter. \n\nEverything is brand-new, I will be the first and only tribute \nto use this Launch Room. The arenas are historic sites, pre-\nserved after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol resi-\ndents to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games, \ntour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took \nplace. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the \nfood is excellent. \n\nI struggle to keep my breakfast down as I shower and clean \nmy teeth. Cinna does my hair in my simple trademark braid \ndown my back. Then the clothes arrive, the same for every \ntribute. Cinna has had no say in my outfit, does not even know \nwhat will be in the package, but he helps me dress in the un-\n\n\n\n \n\n144 \n \n\ndergarments, simple tawny pants, light green blouse, sturdy \nbrown belt, and thin, hooded black jacket that falls to my \nthighs. \u201cThe material in the jacket\u2019s designed to reflect body \nheat. Expect some cool nights,\u201d he says. \n\nThe boots, worn over skintight socks, are better than I \ncould have hoped for. Soft leather not unlike my ones at home. \nThese have a narrow flexible rubber sole with treads though. \nGood for running. \n\nI think I\u2019m finished when Cinna pulls the gold mockingjay \npin from his pocket. I had completely forgotten about it. \n\n\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cOff the green outfit you wore on the train,\u201d he says. I re-\n\nmember now taking it off my mother\u2019s dress, pinning it to the \nshirt. \u201cIt\u2019s your district token, right?\u201d I nod and he fastens it on \nmy shirt. \u201cIt barely cleared the review board. Some thought \nthe pin could be used as a weapon, giving you an unfair advan-\ntage. But eventually, they let it through,\u201d says Cinna. \u201cThey \neliminated a ring from that District One girl, though. If you \ntwisted the gemstone, a spike popped out. Poisoned one. She \nclaimed she had no knowledge the ring transformed and there \nwas no way to prove she did. But she lost her token. There, \nyou\u2019re all set. Move around. Make sure everything feels com-\nfortable.\u201d \n\nI walk, run in a circle, swing my arms about. \u201cYes, it\u2019s fine. \nFits perfectly.\u201d \n\n\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing to do but wait for the call,\u201d says Cin-\nna. \u201cUnless you think you could eat any more?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n145 \n \n\nI turn down food but accept a glass of water that I take tiny \nsips of as we wait on a couch. I don\u2019t want to chew on my nails \nor lips, so I find myself gnawing on the inside of my cheek. It \nstill hasn\u2019t fully healed from a few days ago. Soon the taste of \nblood fills my mouth. \n\nNervousness seeps into terror as I anticipate what is to \ncome. I could be dead, flat-out dead, in an hour. Not even. My \nfingers obsessively trace the hard little lump on my forearm \nwhere the woman injected the tracking device. I press on it, \neven though it hurts, I press on it so hard a small bruise be-\ngins to form. \n\n\u201cDo you want to talk, Katniss?\u201d Cinna asks. \nI shake my head but after a moment hold out my hand to \n\nhim. Cinna encloses it in both of his. And this is how we sit un-\ntil a pleasant female voice announces it\u2019s time to prepare for \nlaunch. \n\nStill clenching one of Cinna\u2019s hands, I walk over and stand \non the circular metal plate. \u201cRemember what Haymitch said. \nRun, find water. The rest will follow,\u201d he says. I nod. \u201cAnd re-\nmember this. I\u2019m not allowed to bet, but if I could, my money \nwould be on you.\u201d \n\n\u201cTruly?\u201d I whisper. \n\u201cTruly,\u201d says Cinna. He leans down and kisses me on the \n\nforehead. \u201cGood luck, girl on fire.\u201d And then a glass cylinder is \nlowering around me, breaking our handhold, cutting him off \nfrom me. He taps his fingers under his chin. Head high. \n\nI lift my chin and stand as straight as I can. The cylinder be-\ngins to rise. For maybe fifteen seconds, I\u2019m in darkness and \n\n\n\n \n\n146 \n \n\nthen I can feel the metal plate pushing me out of the cylinder, \ninto the open air. For a moment, my eyes are dazzled by the \nbright sunlight and I\u2019m conscious only of a strong wind with \nthe hopeful smell of pine trees. \n\nThen I hear the legendary announcer, Claudius Temples-\nmith, as his voice booms all around me. \n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger \nGames begin!\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n147 \n \n\n \n \n \nSixty seconds. That\u2019s how long we\u2019re required to stand on \n\nour metal circles before the sound of a gong releases us. Step \noff before the minute is up, and land mines blow your legs off. \nSixty seconds to take in the ring of tributes all equidistant \nfrom the Cornucopia, a giant golden horn shaped like a cone \nwith a curved tail, the mouth of which is at least twenty feet \nhigh, spilling over with the things that will give us life here in \nthe arena. Food, containers of water, weapons, medicine, gar-\nments, fire starters. Strewn around the Cornucopia are other \nsupplies, their value decreasing the farther they are from the \nhorn. For instance, only a few steps from my feet lays a three-\nfoot square of plastic. Certainly it could be of some use in a \ndownpour. But there in the mouth, I can see a tent pack that \nwould protect from almost any sort of weather. If I had the \nguts to go in and fight for it against the other twenty-three tri-\nbutes. Which I have been instructed not to do. \n\nWe\u2019re on a flat, open stretch of ground. A plain of hard-\npacked dirt. Behind the tributes across from me, I can see \nnothing, indicating either a steep downward slope or even \ncliff. To my right lies a lake. To my left and back, spars piney \nwoods. This is where Haymitch would want me to go. Imme-\ndiately. \n\n\n\n \n\n148 \n \n\nI hear his instructions in my head. \u201cJust clear out, put as \nmuch distance as you can between yourselves and the others, \nand find a source of water.\u201d \n\nBut it\u2019s tempting, so tempting, when I see the bounty wait-\ning there before me. And I know that if I don\u2019t get it, someone \nelse will. That the Career Tributes who survive the bloodbath \nwill divide up most of these life-sustaining spoils. Something \ncatches my eye. There, resting on a mound of blanket rolls, is a \nsilver sheath of arrows and a bow, already strung, just waiting \nto be engaged. That\u2019s mine, I think. It\u2019s meant for me. \n\nI\u2019m fast. I can sprint faster than any of the girls in our \nschool although a couple can beat me in distance races. But \nthis forty-yard length, this is what I am built for. I know I can \nget it, I know I can reach it first, but then the question is how \nquickly can I get out of there? By the time I\u2019ve scrambled up \nthe packs and grabbed the weapons, others will have reached \nthe horn, and one or two I might be able to pick off, but say \nthere\u2019s a dozen, at that close range, they could take me down \nwith the spears and the clubs. Or their own powerful fists. \n\nStill, I won\u2019t be the only target. I\u2019m betting many of the oth-\ner tributes would pass up a smaller girl, even one who scored \nan eleven in training, to take out their more fierce adversaries. \n\nHaymitch has never seen me run. Maybe if he had he\u2019d tell \nme to go for it. Get the weapon. Since that\u2019s the very weapon \nthat might be my salvation. And I only see one bow in that \nwhole pile. I know the minute must be almost up and will have \nto decide what my strategy will be and I find myself position-\ning my feet to run, not away into the stir rounding forests but \n\n\n\n \n\n149 \n \n\ntoward the pile, toward the bow. When suddenly I notice Pee-\nta, he\u2019s about five tributes to my right, quite a fair distance, \nstill I can tell he\u2019s looking at me and I think he might be shak-\ning his head. But the sun\u2019s in my eyes, and while I\u2019m puzzling \nover it the gong rings out. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve missed it! I\u2019ve missed my chance! Because those \nextra couple of seconds I\u2019ve lost by not being ready are \nenough to change my mind about going in. My feet shuffle for \na moment, confused at the direction my brain wants to take \nand then I lunge forward, scoop up the sheet of plastic and a \nloaf of bread. The pickings are so small and I\u2019m so angry with \nPeeta for distracting me that I sprint in twenty yards to re-\ntrieve a bright orange backpack that could hold anything be-\ncause I can\u2019t stand leaving with virtually nothing. \n\nA boy, I think from District 9, reaches the pack at the same \ntime I do and for a brief time we grapple for it and then he \ncoughs, splattering my face with blood. I stagger back, re-\npulsed by the warm, sticky spray. Then the boy slips to the \nground. That\u2019s when I see the knife in his back. Already other \ntributes have reached the Cornucopia and are spreading out \nto attack. Yes, the girl from District 2, ten yards away, running \ntoward me, one hand clutching a half-dozen knives. I\u2019ve seen \nher throw in training. She never misses. And I\u2019m her next tar-\nget. \n\nAll the general fear I\u2019ve been feeling condenses into at im-\nmediate fear of this girl, this predator who might kill me in \nseconds. Adrenaline shoots through me and I sling the pack \nover one shoulder and run full-speed for the woods. I can hear \n\n\n\n \n\n150 \n \n\nthe blade whistling toward me and reflexively hike the pack \nup to protect my head. The blade lodges in the pack. Both \nstraps on my shoulders now, I make for the trees. Somehow I \nknow the girl will not pursue me. That she\u2019ll be drawn back in-\nto the Cornucopia before all the good stuff is gone. A grin \ncrosses my face. Thanks for the knife, I think. \n\nAt the edge of the woods I turn for one instant to survey the \nfield. About a dozen or so tributes are hacking away at one \nanother at the horn. Several lie dead already on the ground. \nThose who have taken flight are disappearing into the trees or \ninto the void opposite me. I continue running until the woods \nhave hidden me from the other tributes then slow into a \nsteady jog that I think I can maintain for a while. For the next \nfew hours, I alternate between jogging and walking, putting as \nmuch distance as I can between myself and my competitors. I \nlost my bread during the struggle with the boy from District 9 \nbut managed to stuff my plastic in my sleeve so as I walk I fold \nit neatly and tuck it into a pocket. I also free the knife \u2014 it\u2019s a \nfine one with a long sharp blade, serrated near the handle, \nwhich will make it handy for sawing through things \u2014 and \nslide it into my belt. I don\u2019t dare stop to examine the contents \nof the pack yet. I just keep moving, pausing only to check for \npursuers. \n\nI can go a long time. I know that from my days in the \nwoods. But I will need water. That was Haymitch\u2019s second in-\nstruction, and since I sort of botched the first, I keep a sharp \neye out for any sign of it. No luck. \n\n\n\n \n\n151 \n \n\nThe woods begin to evolve, and the pines are intermixed \nwith a variety of trees, some I recognize, some completely for-\neign to me. At one point, I hear a noise and pull my knife, \nthinking I may have to defend myself, but I\u2019ve only startled a \nrabbit. \u201cGood to see you,\u201d I whisper. If there\u2019s one rabbit, there \ncould be hundreds just waiting to be snared. \n\nThe ground slopes down. I don\u2019t particularly like this. Val-\nleys make me feel trapped. I want to be high, like in the hills \naround District 12, where I can see my enemies approaching. \nBut I have no choice but to keep going. \n\nFunny though, I don\u2019t feel too bad. The days of gorging my-\nself have paid off. I\u2019ve got staying power even though I\u2019m \nshort on sleep. Being in the woods is rejuvenating. I\u2019m glad for \nthe solitude, even though it\u2019s an illusion, because I\u2019m probably \non-screen right now. Not consistently but off and on. There \nare so many deaths to show the first day that a tribute trekk-\ning through the woods isn\u2019t much to look at. But they\u2019ll show \nme enough to let people know I\u2019m alive, uninjured and on the \nmove. One of the heaviest days of betting is the opening, when \nthe initial casualties come in. But that can\u2019t compare to what \nhappens as the field shrinks to a handful of players. \n\nIt\u2019s late afternoon when I begin to hear the cannons. Each \nshot represents a dead tribute. The fighting must have finally \nstopped at the Cornucopia. They never collect the bloodbath \nbodies until the killers have dispersed. On the opening day, \nthey don\u2019t even fire the cannons until the initial fighting\u2019s over \nbecause it\u2019s too hard to keep track of the fatalities. I allow my-\nself to pause, panting, as I count the shots. One . . . two . . . \n\n\n\n \n\n152 \n \n\nthree . . . on and on until they reach eleven. Eleven dead in all. \nThirteen left to play. My fingernails scrape at the dried blood \nthe boy from District 9 coughed into my face. He\u2019s gone, cer-\ntainly. I wonder about Peeta. Has he lasted through the day? \nI\u2019ll know in a few hours. When they project the dead\u2019s images \ninto the sky for the rest of us to see. \n\nAll of a sudden, I\u2019m overwhelmed by the thought that Peeta \nmay be already lost, bled white, collected, and in the process \nof being transported back to the Capitol to be cleaned up, re-\ndressed, and shipped in a simple wooden box back to District \n12. No longer here. Heading home. I try hard to remember if I \nsaw him once the action started. But the last image I can con-\njure up is Peeta shaking his head as the gong rang out. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s better, if he\u2019s gone already. He had no confidence \nhe could win. And I will not end up with the unpleasant task of \nkilling him. Maybe it\u2019s better if he\u2019s out of this for good. \n\nI slump down next to my pack, exhausted. I need to go \nthrough it anyway before night falls. See what I have to work \nwith. As I unhook the straps, I can feel it\u2019s sturdily made al-\nthough a rather unfortunate color. This orange will practically \nglow in the dark. I make a mental note to camouflage it first \nthing tomorrow. \n\nI flip open the flap. What I want most, right at this moment, \nis water. Haymitch\u2019s directive to immediately find water was \nnot arbitrary. I won\u2019t last long without it. For a few days, I\u2019ll be \nable to function with unpleasant symptoms of dehydration, \nbut after that I'll deteriorate into helplessness and be dead in \na week, tops. I carefully lay out the provisions. One thin black \n\n\n\n \n\n153 \n \n\nsleeping bag that reflects body heal. A pack of crackers. A pack \nof dried beef strips. A bottle of iodine. A box of wooden \nmatches. A small coil of wire. A pair of sunglasses. And a half-\ngallon plastic bottle with a cap for carrying water that's bone \ndry. \n\nNo water. How hard would it have been for them to fill up \nthe bottle? I become aware of the dryness in my throat and \nmouth, the cracks in my lips. I've been moving all day long. It's \nbeen hot and I've sweat a lot. I do this at home, but there are \nalways streams to drink from, or snow to melt if it should \ncome to it. \n\nAs I refill my pack I have an awful thought. The lake. The one \nI saw while I was waiting for the gong to sound. What if that's \nthe only water source in the arena? That way they'll guarantee \ndrawing us in to fight. The lake is a full day's journey from \nwhere I sit now, a much harder journey with nothing to drink. \nAnd then, even if I reach it, it's sure to be heavily guarded by \nsome of the Career Tributes. I'm about to panic when I re-\nmember the rabbit I startled earlier today. It has to drink, too. \nI just have to find out where. \n\nTwilight is closing in and I am ill at ease. The trees are too \nthin to offer much concealment. The layer of pine needles that \nmuffles my footsteps also makes tracking animals harder \nwhen I need their trails to find water. And I'm still heading \ndownhill, deeper and deeper into a valley that seems endless. \n\nI\u2019m hungry, too, but I don\u2019t dare break into my precious \nstore of crackers and beef yet. Instead, I take my knife and go \nto work on a pine tree, cutting away the outer bark and scrap-\n\n\n\n \n\n154 \n \n\ning off a large handful of the softer inner bark. I slowly chew \nthe stuff as I walk along. After a week of the finest food in the \nworld, it\u2019s a little hard to choke down. But I\u2019ve eaten plenty of \npine in my life. I\u2019ll adjust quickly. \n\nIn another hour, it\u2019s clear I\u2019ve got to find a place to camp. \nNight creatures are coming out. I can hear the occasional hoot \nor howl, my first clue that I\u2019ll be competing with natural pre-\ndators for the rabbits. As to whether I\u2019ll be viewed as a source \nof food, it\u2019s too soon to tell. There could be any number of an-\nimals stalking me at this moment. \n\nBut right now, I decide to make my fellow tributes a priori-\nty. I\u2019m sure many will continue hunting through the night. \nThose who fought it out at the Cornucopia will have food, an \nabundance of water from the lake, torches or flashlights, and \nweapons they\u2019re itching to use. I can only hope I\u2019ve traveled \nfar and fast enough to be out of range. \n\nBefore settling down, I take my wire and set two twitch-up \nsnares in the brush. I know it\u2019s risky to be setting traps, but \nfood will go so fast out here. And I can\u2019t set snares on the run. \nStill, I walk another five minutes before making camp. \n\nI pick my tree carefully. A willow, not terribly tall but set in \na clump of other willows, offering concealment in those long, \nflowing tresses. I climb up, sticking to the stronger branches \nclose to the trunk, and find a sturdy fork for my bed. It takes \nsome doing, but I arrange the sleeping bag in a relatively com-\nfortable manner. I place my backpack in the foot of the bag, \nthen slide in after it. As a precaution, I remove my belt, loop it \nall the way around the branch and my sleeping bag, and refas-\n\n\n\n \n\n155 \n \n\nten it at my waist. Now if I roll over in my sleep, I won\u2019t go \ncrashing to the ground. I\u2019m small enough to tuck the top of the \nbag over my head, but I put on my hood as well. As night falls, \nthe air is cooling quickly. Despite the risk I took in getting the \nbackpack, I know now it was the right choice. This sleeping \nbag, radiating back and preserving my body heat, will be inva-\nluable. I\u2019m sure there are several other tributes whose biggest \nconcern right now is how to stay warm whereas I may actual-\nly be able to get a few hours of sleep. If only I wasn\u2019t so thirsty \n. . . \n\nNight has just come when I hear the anthem that proceeds \nthe death recap. Through the branches I can see the seal of the \nCapitol, which appears to be floating in the sky. I\u2019m actually \nviewing another screen, an enormous one that\u2019s transported \nby of one of their disappearing hovercraft. The anthem fades \nout and the sky goes dark for a moment. At home, we would \nbe watching full coverage of each and every killing, but that\u2019s \nthought to give an unfair advantage to the living tributes. For \ninstance, if I got my hands on the bow and shot someone, my \nsecret would be revealed to all. No, here in the arena, all we \nsee are the same photographs they showed when they tele-\nvised our training scores. Simple head shots. But now instead \nof scores they post only district numbers. I take a deep breath \nas the face of the eleven dead tributes begin and tick them off \none by one on my fingers. \n\nThe first to appear is the girl from District 3. That means \nthat the Career Tributes from 1 and 2 have all survived. No \nsurprise there. Then the boy from 4. I didn\u2019t expect that one, \n\n\n\n \n\n156 \n \n\nusually all the Careers make it through the first day. The boy \nfrom District 5 . . . I guess the fox-faced girl made it. Both tri-\nbutes from 6 and 7. The boy from 8. Both from 9. Yes, there\u2019s \nthe boy who I fought for the backpack. I\u2019ve run through my \nfingers, only one more dead tribute to go. Is it Peeta? No, \nthere\u2019s the girl from District 10. That\u2019s it. The Capitol seal is \nback with a final musical flourish. Then darkness and the \nsounds of the forest resume. \n\nI\u2019m relieved Peeta\u2019s alive. I tell myself again that if I get \nkilled, his winning will benefit my mother and Prim the most. \nThis is what I tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions \nthat arise when I think of Peeta. The gratitude that he gave me \nan edge by professing his love for me in the interview. The an-\nger at his superiority on the roof. The dread that we may come \nface-to-face at any moment in this arena. \n\nEleven dead, but none from District 12. I try to work out \nwho is left. Five Career Tributes. Foxface. Thresh and Rue. Rue \n. . . so she made it through the first day after all. I can\u2019t help \nfeeling glad. That makes ten of us. The other three I\u2019ll figure \nout tomorrow. Now when it is dark, and I have traveled far, \nand I am nestled high in this tree, now I must try and rest. \n\nI haven\u2019t really slept in two days, and then there\u2019s been the \nlong day\u2019s journey into the arena. Slowly, I allow my muscles \nto relax. My eyes to close. The last thing I think is it\u2019s lucky I \ndon\u2019t snore. . . . \n\nSnap! The sound of a breaking branch wakes me. How long \nhave I been asleep? Four hours? Five? The tip of my nose is icy \ncold. Snap! Snap! What\u2019s going on? This is not the sound of a \n\n\n\n \n\n157 \n \n\nbranch under someone\u2019s foot, but the sharp crack of one com-\ning from a tree. Snap! Snap! I judge it to be several hundred \nyards to my right. Slowly, noiselessly, I turn myself in that di-\nrection. For a few minutes, there\u2019s nothing but blackness and \nsome scuffling. Then I see a spark and a small fire begins to \nbloom. A pair of hands warms over flames, but I can\u2019t make \nout more than that. \n\nI have to bite my lip not to scream every foul name I know \nat the fire starter. What are they thinking? A fire I\u2019ll just at \nnightfall would have been one thing. Those who battled at the \nCornucopia, with their superior strength and surplus of sup-\nplies, they couldn\u2019t possibly have been near enough to spot \nthe flames then. But now, when they\u2019ve probably been com-\nbing the woods for hours looking for victims. You might as \nwell be waving a flag and shouting, \u201cCome and get me!\u201d \n\nAnd here I am a stone\u2019s throw from the biggest idiot in \nthe Games. Strapped in a tree. Not daring to flee since my \ngeneral location has just been broadcast to any killer who \ncares. I mean, I know it\u2019s cold out here and not everybody \nhas a sleeping bag. But then you grit your teeth and stick it \nout until dawn! \n\nI lay smoldering in my bag for the next couple of hours real-\nly thinking that if I can get out of this tree, I won\u2019t have the \nleast problem taking out my new neighbor. My instinct has \nbeen to flee, not fight. But obviously this person\u2019s a hazard. \nStupid people are dangerous. And this one probably doesn\u2019t \nhave much in the way of weapons while I\u2019ve got this excellent \nknife. \n\n\n\n \n\n158 \n \n\nThe sky is still dark, but I can feel the first signs of dawn \napproaching. I\u2019m beginning to think we \u2014 meaning the person \nwhose death I\u2019m now devising and me \u2014 we might actually \nhave gone unnoticed. Then I hear it. Several pairs of feet \nbreaking into a run. The fire starter must have dozed off. \nThey\u2019re on her before she can escape. I know it\u2019s a girl now, I \ncan tell by the pleading, the agonized scream that follows. \nThen there\u2019s laughter and congratulations from several voices. \nSomeone cries out, \u201cTwelve down and eleven to go!\u201d which \ngets a round of appreciative hoots. \n\nSo they\u2019re fighting in a pack. I\u2019m not really surprised. Often \nalliances are formed in the early stages of the Games. The \nstrong band together to hunt down the weak then, when the \ntension becomes too great, begin to turn on one another. I \ndon\u2019t have to wonder too hard who has made this alliance. It\u2019ll \nbe the remaining Career Tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4. \nTwo boys and three girls. The ones who lunched together. \n\nFor a moment, I hear them checking the girl for supplies. I \ncan tell by their comments they\u2019ve found nothing good. I won-\nder if the victim is Rue but quickly dismiss the thought. She\u2019s \nmuch too bright to be building a fire like that. \n\n\u201cBetter clear out so they can get the body before it starts \nstinking.\u201d I\u2019m almost certain that\u2019s the brutish boy from Dis-\ntrict 2. There are murmurs of assent and then, to my horror, I \nhear the pack heading toward me. They do not know I\u2019m here. \nHow could they? And I\u2019m well concealed in the clump of trees. \nAt least while the sun stays down. Then my black sleeping bag \n\n\n\n \n\n159 \n \n\nwill turn from camouflage to trouble. If they just keep moving, \nthey will pass me and be gone in a minute. \n\nBut the Careers stop in the clearing about ten yards from \nmy tree. They have flashlights, torches. I can see an arm here, \na boot there, through the breaks in the branches. I turn to \nstone, not even daring to breathe. Have they spotted me? No, \nnot yet. I can tell from their words their minds are elsewhere. \n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we have heard a cannon by now?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d say yes. Nothing to prevent them from going in imme-\n\ndiately.\u201d \n\u201cUnless she isn\u2019t dead.\u201d \n\u201cShe\u2019s dead. I stuck her myself.\u201d \n\u201cThen where\u2019s the cannon?\u201d \n\u201cSomeone should go back. Make sure the job\u2019s done.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, we don\u2019t want to have to track her down twice.\u201d \n\u201cI said she\u2019s dead!\u201d \nAn argument breaks out until one tribute silences the oth-\n\ners. \u201cWe\u2019re wasting time! I\u2019ll go finish her and let\u2019s move on!\u201d \nI almost fall out of the tree. The voice belongs to Peeta. \n\n\n\n \n\n160 \n \n\n \n \n \nThank goodness, I had the foresight to belt myself in. I\u2019ve \n\nrolled sideways off the fork and I\u2019m facing the ground, held in \nplace by the belt, one hand, and my feet straddling the pack \ninside my sleeping bag, braced against the trunk. There must \nhave been some rustling when I tipped sideways, but the Ca-\nreers have been too caught up in their own argument to catch \nit. \n\n\u201cGo on, then, Lover Boy,\u201d says the boy from District 2. \u201cSee \nfor yourself.\u201d \n\nI just get a glimpse of Peeta, lit by a torch, heading back to \nthe girl by the fire. His face is swollen with bruises, there\u2019s a \nbloody bandage on one arm, and from the sound of his gait \nhe\u2019s limping somewhat. I remember him shaking him his head, \ntelling me not to go into the fight for the supplies, when all \nalong, all along he\u2019d planned to throw himself into the thick of \nthings. Just the opposite of what Haymitch had mid him to do. \n\nOkay, I can stomach that. Seeing all those supplies was \ntempting. But this . . . this other thing. This teaming up with \nthe Career wolf pack to hunt down the rest of us. No one from \nDistrict 12 would think of doing such a thing! Career tributes \nare overly vicious, arrogant, better fed, but only because \nthey\u2019re the Capitol\u2019s lapdogs. \n\n\n\n \n\n161 \n \n\nUniversally, solidly hated by all but those from their own \ndistricts. I can imagine the things they\u2019re saying about him \nback home now. And Peeta had the gall to talk to me about \ndisgrace? \n\nObviously, the noble boy on the rooftop was playing just \none more game with me. But this will be his last. I will eagerly \nwatch the night skies for signs of his death, if I don\u2019t kill him \nfirst myself. \n\nThe Career tributes are silent until he gets out of ear shot, \nthen use hushed voices. \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just kill him now and get it over with?\u201d \n\u201cLet him tag along. What\u2019s the harm? And he\u2019s handy with \n\nthat knife.\u201d \nIs he? That\u2019s news. What a lot of interesting things I\u2019m \n\nlearning about my friend Peeta today. \n\u201cBesides, he\u2019s our best chance of finding her.\u201d \nIt takes me a moment to register that the \u201cher\u201d they\u2019re re-\n\nferring to is me. \n\u201cWhy? You think she bought into that sappy romance \n\nstuff?\u201d \n\u201cShe might have. Seemed pretty simpleminded to me. Every \n\ntime I think about her spinning around in that dress, I want to \npuke.\u201d \n\n\u201cWish we knew how she got that eleven.\u201d \n\u201cBet you Lover Boy knows.\u201d \nThe sound of Peeta returning silences them. \n\u201cWas she dead?\u201d asks the boy from District 2. \n\n\n\n \n\n162 \n \n\n\u201cNo. But she is now,\u201d says Peeta. Just then, the cannon fires. \n\u201cReady to move on?\u201d \n\nThe Career pack sets off at a run just as dawn begins to \nbreak, and birdsong fills the air. I remain in my awkward posi-\ntion, muscles trembling with exertion for a while longer, then \nhoist myself back onto my branch. I need to get down, to get \ngoing, but for a moment I lie there, digesting what I\u2019ve heard. \nNot only is Peeta with the Careers, he\u2019s helping them find me. \nThe simpleminded girl who has to be taken seriously because \nof her eleven. Because she can use a bow and arrow. Which \nPeeta knows better than anyone. \n\nBut he hasn\u2019t told them yet. Is he saving that information \nbecause he knows it\u2019s all that keeps him alive? Is he still pre-\ntending to love me for the audience? What is going on in his \nhead? \n\nSuddenly, the birds fall silent. Then one gives a high-\npitched warning call. A single note. Just like the one Gale and I \nheard when the redheaded Avox girl was caught. High above \nthe dying campfire a hovercraft materializes. A set of huge \nmetal teeth drops down. Slowly, gently, the dead tribute girl is \nlifted into the hovercraft. Then it vanishes. The birds resume \ntheir song. \n\n\u201cMove,\u201d I whisper to myself. I wriggle out of my sleeping \nbag, roll it up, and place it in the pack. I take a deep breath. \nWhile I\u2019ve been concealed by darkness and the sleeping bag \nand the willow branches, it has probably been difficult for the \ncameras to get a good shot of me. I know they must be track-\n\n\n\n \n\n163 \n \n\ning me now though. The minute I hit the ground, I\u2019m guaran-\nteed a close-up. \n\nThe audience will have been beside themselves, knowing I \nwas in the tree, that I overheard the Careers talking, that I dis-\ncovered Peeta was with them. Until I work out exactly how I \nwant to play that, I\u2019d better at least act on top of things. Not \nperplexed. Certainly not confused or frightened. \n\nNo, I need to look one step ahead of the game. \nSo as I slide out of the foliage and into the dawn light, I \n\npause a second, giving the cameras time to lock on me. Then I \ncock my head slightly to the side and give a knowing smile. \nThere! Let them figure out what that means! \n\nI\u2019m about to take off when I think of my snares. Maybe it\u2019s \nimprudent to check them with the others so close. But have to. \nToo many years of hunting, I guess. And the lure of possible \nmeat. I\u2019m rewarded with one fine rabbit. In no time, I\u2019ve \ncleaned and gutted the animal, leaving the head, feet, tail, skin, \nand innards, under a pile of leaves. I\u2019m wishing for a fire \u2014 \neating raw rabbit can give you rabbit fever, a lesson I learned \nthe hard way \u2014 when I think of the dead tribute. I hurry back \nto her camp. Sure enough, the coals of her dying fire are still \nhot. I cut up the rabbit, fashion a spit out of branches, and set \nit over the coals. \n\nI\u2019m glad for the cameras now. I want sponsors to see I can \nhunt, that I\u2019m a good bet because I won\u2019t be lured into traps as \neasily as the others will by hunger. While the rabbit cooks, I \ngrind up part of a charred branch and set about camouflaging \nmy orange pack. The black tones it down, but I feel a layer of \n\n\n\n \n\n164 \n \n\nmud would definitely help. Of course, to have mud, I\u2019d need \nwater . . . \n\nI pull on my gear, grab my spit, kick some dirt over the \ncoals, and take off in the opposite direction the Careers went. I \neat half the rabbit as I go, then wrap up the leftovers in my \nplastic for later. The meat stops the grumbling in my stomach \nbut does little to quench my thirst. Water is my top priority \nnow. \n\nAs I hike along, I feel certain I\u2019m still holding the screen in \nthe Capitol, so I\u2019m careful to continue to hide my emotions. \nBut what a good time Claudius Templesmith must be having \nwith his guest commentators, dissecting Peeta\u2019s behavior, my \nreaction. What to make of it all? Has Peeta revealed his true \ncolors? How does this affect the betting odds? Will we lose \nsponsors? Do we even have sponsors? Yes, I feel certain we \ndo, or at least did. \n\nCertainly Peeta has thrown a wrench into our star-crossed \nlover dynamic. Or has he? Maybe, since he hasn\u2019t spoken much \nabout me, we can still get some mileage out of it. Maybe \npeople will think it\u2019s something we plotted together if I seem \nlike it amuses me now. \n\nThe sun rises in the sky and even through the canopy it \nseems overly bright. I coat my lips in some grease from the \nrabbit and try to keep from panting, but it\u2019s no use. It\u2019s only \nbeen a day and I\u2019m dehydrating fast. I try and think of every-\nthing I know about finding water. It runs downhill, so, in fact, \ncontinuing down into this valley isn\u2019t a bad thing. If I could \njust locate a game trail or spot a particularly green patch of \n\n\n\n \n\n165 \n \n\nvegetation, these might help me along, but nothing seems to \nchange. There\u2019s just the slight gradual slope, the birds, the \nsameness to the trees. \n\nAs the day wears on, I know I\u2019m headed for trouble. What \nlittle urine I\u2019ve been able to pass is a dark brown, my head is \naching, and there\u2019s a dry patch on my tongue that refuses to \nmoisten. The sun hurts my eyes so I dig out my sunglasses, but \nwhen I put them on they do something funny to my vision, so I \njust stuff them back in my pack. \n\nIt\u2019s late afternoon when I think I\u2019ve found help. I spot a \ncluster of berry bushes and hurry to strip the fruit, to suck the \nsweet juices from the skins. But just as I\u2019m holding them to my \nlips, I get a hard look at them. What I thought were blueber-\nries have a slightly different shape, and when I break one open \nthe insides are bloodred. I don\u2019t recognize these berries, per-\nhaps they are edible, but I\u2019m guessing this is some evil trick on \nthe part of the Gamemakers. Even the plant instructor in the \nTraining Center made a point of telling us to avoid berries un-\nless you were 100 percent sure they weren\u2019t toxic. Something \nI already knew, but I\u2019m so thirsty it takes her reminder to give \nme the strength to fling them away. \n\nFatigue is beginning to settle on me, but it\u2019s not the usual \ntiredness that follows a long hike. I have to stop and rest fre-\nquently, although I know the only cure for what ails me re-\nquires continued searching. I try a new tactic \u2014 climbing a \ntree as high as I dare in my shaky state \u2014 to look for any signs \nof water. But as far as I can see in any direction, there\u2019s the \nsame unrelenting stretch of forest. \n\n\n\n \n\n166 \n \n\nDetermined to go on until nightfall, I walk until I\u2019m stum-\nbling over my own feet. \n\nExhausted, I haul myself up into a tree and belt myself in. \nI\u2019ve no appetite, but I suck on a rabbit bone just to give my \nmouth something to do. Night falls, the anthem plays, and high \nin the sky I see the picture of the girl, who was apparently \nfrom District 8. The one Peeta went back to finish off. \n\nMy fear of the Career pack is minor compared to my burn-\ning thirst. Besides, they were heading away from me and by \nnow they, too, will have to rest. With the scarcity of water, \nthey may even have had to return to the lake for refills. \n\nMaybe, that is the only course for me as well. \nMorning brings distress. My heads throbs with every beat \n\nof my heart. Simple movements send stabs of pain through my \njoints. I fall, rather than jump from the tree. It takes several \nminutes for me to assemble my gear. Somewhere inside me, I \nknow this is wrong. I should be acting with more caution, \nmoving with more urgency. But my mind seems foggy and \nforming a plan is hard. I lean back against the trunk of my \ntree, one finger gingerly stroking the sandpaper surface of my \ntongue, as I assess my options. How can I get water? \n\nReturn to the lake. No good. I\u2019d never make it. \nHope for rain. There\u2019s not a cloud in the sky. \nKeep looking. Yes, this is my only chance. But then, another \n\nthought hits me, and the surge of anger that follows brings me \nto me senses. \n\nHaymitch! He could send me water! Press a button and \nhave it delivered to me in a silver parachute in minutes. I \n\n\n\n \n\n167 \n \n\nknow I must have sponsors, at least one or two who could af-\nford a pint of liquid for me. Yes, it\u2019s pricey, but these people, \nthey\u2019re made of money. And they\u2019ll be betting on me as well. \nPerhaps Haymitch doesn\u2019t realize how deep my need is. \n\nI say in a voice as loud as I dare. \u201cWater.\u201d I wait, hopefully, \nfor a parachute to descend from the sky. But nothing is forth-\ncoming. \n\nSomething is wrong. Am I deluded about having sponsors? \nOr has Peeta\u2019s behavior made them all hang back? No, I don\u2019t \nbelieve it. There\u2019s someone out there who wants to buy me \nwater only Haymitch is refusing to let it go through. As my \nmentor, he gets to control the flow of gifts from the sponsors. I \nknow he hates me. He\u2019s made that clear enough. But enough to \nlet me die? From this? He can\u2019t do that, can he? If a mentor mi-\nstreats his tributes, he\u2019ll be held accountable by the viewers, \nby the people back in District 12. Even Haymitch wouldn\u2019t risk \nthat, would he? Say what you will about my fellow traders in \nthe Hob, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d welcome him back there if he \nlet me die this way. And then where would he get his liquor? \nSo . . . what? Is he trying to make me suffer for defying him? Is \nhe directing all the sponsors toward Peeta? Is he just too \ndrunk to even notice what\u2019s going on at the moment? Some-\nhow I don\u2019t believe that and I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s trying to kill \nme off by neglect, either. He has, in fact, in his own unpleasant \nway, genuinely been trying to prepare me for this. Then what \nis going on? \n\nI bury my face in my hands. There\u2019s no danger of tears now, \nI couldn\u2019t produce one to save my life. What is Haymitch \n\n\n\n \n\n168 \n \n\ndoing? Despite my anger, hatred, and suspicions, a small voice \nin the back of my head whispers an answer. \n\nMaybe he\u2019s sending you a message, it says. A message. Say-\ning what? Then I know. There\u2019s only one good reason Hay-\nmitch could be withholding water from me. Because he knows \nI\u2019ve almost found it. \n\nI grit my teeth and pull myself to my feet. My backpack \nseems to have tripled in weight. I find a broken branch that \nwill do for a walking stick and I start off. The sun\u2019s beating \ndown, even more searing than the first two days. I feel like an \nold piece of leather, drying and cracking in the heat. every \nstep is an effort, but I refuse to stop. I refuse to sit down. If I \nsit, there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t be able to get up again, that I \nwon\u2019t even remember my task. \n\nWhat easy prey I am! Any tribute, even tiny Rue, could take \nme right now, merely shove me over and kill me with my own \nknife, and I\u2019d have little strength to resist. But if anyone is in \nmy part of the woods, they ignore me. The truth is, I feel a mil-\nlion miles from another living soul. \n\nNot alone though. No, they\u2019ve surely got a camera tracking \nme now. I think back to the years of watching tributes starve, \nfreeze, bleed, and dehydrate to death. Unless there\u2019s a really \ngood fight going on somewhere, I\u2019m being featured. \n\nMy thoughts turn to Prim. It\u2019s likely she won\u2019t be watching \nme live, but they\u2019ll show updates at the school during lunch. \nFor her sake, I try to look as least desperate as I can. \n\n\n\n \n\n169 \n \n\nBut by afternoon, I know the end is coming. My legs are \nshaking and my heart too quick. I keep forgetting, exactly \nwhat I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve stumbled repeatedly and managed to re-\ngain my feet, but when the stick slides out from under me, I fi-\nnally tumble to the ground unable to get up. I let my eyes \nclose. \n\nI have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping \nme at all. \n\nThis is all right, I think. This is not so bad here. The air is less \nhot, signifying evening\u2019s approach. There\u2019s a slight, sweet \nscent that reminds me of lilies. My fingers stroke the smooth \nground, sliding easily across the top. This is an okay place to \n\ndie, I think. \nMy fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, \n\nslippery earth. I love mud, I think. How many times I\u2019ve \ntracked game with the help of its soft, readable surface. Good \nfor bee stings, too. Mud. Mud. Mud! My eyes fly open and I dig \nmy fingers into the earth. It is mud! My nose lifts in the air. \nAnd those are lilies! Pond lilies! \n\nI crawl now, through the mud, dragging myself toward the \nscent. Five yards from where I fell, I crawl through a tangle of \nplants into a pond. Floating on the top, yellow flowers in \nbloom, are my beautiful lilies. \n\nIt\u2019s all I can do not to plunge my face into the water and \ngulp down as much as I can hold. But I have jus enough sense \nleft to abstain. With trembling hands, I get out my flask and fill \nit with water. I add what I remember to be the right number of \n\n\n\n \n\n170 \n \n\ndrops of iodine for purifying it. The half an hour of waiting is \nagony, but I do it. At least, \n\nI think it\u2019s a half an hour, but it\u2019s certainly as long as I can \nstand. \n\nSlowly, easy now, I tell myself. I take one swallow and make \nmyself wait. Then another. Over the next couple of hours, I \ndrink the entire half gallon. Then a second. I prepare another \nbefore I retire to a tree where I continue sipping, eating rab-\nbit, and even indulge in one of my precious crackers. By the \ntime the anthem plays, I feel remarkably better. There are no \nfaces tonight, no tributes died today. Tomorrow I\u2019ll stay here, \nresting, camouflaging my backpack with mud, catching some \nof those little fish I saw as I sipped, digging up the roots of the \npond lilies to make a nice meal. I snuggle down in my sleeping \nbag, hanging on to my water bottle for dear life, which, of \ncourse, it is. \n\nA few hours later, the stampede of feet shakes me from \nslumber. I look around in bewilderment. It\u2019s not yet dawn, but \nmy stinging eyes can see it. \n\nIt would be hard to miss the wall of fire descending on me. \n\n\n\n \n\n171 \n \n\n \n \n \nMy first impulse is to scramble from the tree, but I\u2019m belted \n\nin. Somehow my fumbling fingers release the buckle and I fall \nto the ground in a heap, still snarled in my sleeping bag. \nThere\u2019s no time for any kind of packing. Fortunately, my \nbackpack and water bottle are already in the bag. I shove in \nthe belt, hoist the bag over my shoulder, and flee. \n\nThe world has transformed to flame and smoke. Burning \nbranches crack from trees and fall in showers of sparks at my \nfeet. All I can do is follow the others, the rabbits and deer and I \neven spot a wild dog pack shooting through the woods. I trust \ntheir sense of direction because their instincts are sharper \nthan mine. But they are much faster, flying through the un-\nderbrush so gracefully as my boots catch on roots and fallen \ntree limbs, that there\u2019s no way I can keep apace with them. \n\nThe heat is horrible, but worse than the heat is the smoke, \nwhich threatens to suffocate me at any moment. I pull the top \nof my shirt up over my nose, grateful to find it soaked in \nsweat, and it offers a thin veil of protection. And I run, chok-\ning, my bag banging against my back, my face cut with \nbranches that materialize from the gray haze without warn-\ning, because I know I am supposed to run. \n\n\n\n \n\n172 \n \n\nThis was no tribute\u2019s campfire gone out of control, no acci-\ndental occurrence. The flames that bear down on me have an \nunnatural height, a uniformity that marks them as human-\nmade, machine-made, Gamemaker-made. Things have been \ntoo quiet today. No deaths, perhaps no fights at all. The au-\ndience in the Capitol will be getting bored, claiming that these \nGames are verging on dullness. This is the one thing the \nGames must not do. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to follow the Gamemakers\u2019 motivation. There \nis the Career pack and then there are the rest of us, probably \nspread far and thin across the arena. This fire is designed to \nflush us out, to drive us together. It may not be the most origi-\nnal device I\u2019ve seen, but it\u2019s very, very effective. \n\nI hurdle over a burning log. Not high enough. The tail end of \nmy jacket catches on fire and I have to stop to rip it from my \nbody and stamp out the flames. But I don\u2019t dare leave the \njacket, scorched and smoldering as it is, I take the risk of shov-\ning it in my sleeping bag, hoping the lack of air will quell what \nI haven\u2019t extinguished. This is all I have, what I carry on my \nback, and it\u2019s little enough to survive with. \n\nIn a matter of minutes, my throat and nose are burning. The \ncoughing begins soon after and my lungs begin to feel as if \nthey are actually being cooked. Discomfort turns to distress \nuntil each breath sends a searing pain through my chest. I \nmanage to take cover under a stone outcropping just as the \nvomiting begins, and I lose my meager supper and whatever \nwater has remained in my stomach. Crouching on my hands \nand knees, I retch until there\u2019s nothing left to come up. \n\n\n\n \n\n173 \n \n\nI know I need to keep moving, but I\u2019m trembling and light-\nheaded now, gasping for air. I allow myself about a spoonful of \nwater to rinse my mouth and spit then take a few swallows \nfrom my bottle. You get one minute, I tell myself. One minute to \n\nrest. I take the time to reorder my supplies, wad up the sleep-\ning bag, and messily stuff everything into the backpack. My \nminute\u2019s up. I know it\u2019s time to move on, but the smoke has \nclouded my thoughts. The swift-footed animals that were my \ncompass have left me behind. I know I haven\u2019t been in this \npart of the woods before, there were no sizable rocks like the \none I\u2019m sheltering against on my earlier travels. Where are the \nGamemakers driving me? Back to the lake? To a whole new \nterrain filled with new dangers? I had just found a few hours \nof peace at the pond when this attack began. Would there be \nany way I could travel parallel to the fire and work my way \nback there, to a source of water at least? The wall of fire must \nhave an end and it won\u2019t burn indefinitely. Not because the \nGamemakers couldn\u2019t keep it fueled but because, again, that \nwould invite accusations of boredom from the audience. If I \ncould get back behind the fire line, I could avoid meeting up \nwith the Careers. I\u2019ve just decided to try and loop back \naround, although it will require miles of travel away from the \ninferno and then a very circuitous route back, when the first \nfireball blasts into the rock about two feet from my head. I \nspring out from under my ledge, energized by renewed fear. \n\nThe game has taken a twist. The fire was just to get us mov-\ning, now the audience will get to see some real fun. When I \nhear the next hiss, I flatten on the ground, not taking time to \n\n\n\n \n\n174 \n \n\nlook. The fireball hits a tree off to my left, engulfing it in \nflames. To remain still is death. I\u2019m barely on my feet before \nthe third ball hits the ground where I was lying, sending a pil-\nlar of fire up behind me. Time loses meaning now as I franti-\ncally try to dodge the attacks. I can\u2019t see where they\u2019re being \nlaunched from, but it\u2019s not a hovercraft. The angles are not ex-\ntreme enough. Probably this whole segment of the woods has \nbeen armed with precision launchers that are concealed in \ntrees or rocks. Somewhere, in a cool and spotless room, a Ga-\nmemaker sits at a set of controls, fingers on the triggers that \ncould end my life in a second. All that is needed is a direct hit. \n\nWhatever vague plan I had conceived regarding returning \nto my pond is wiped from my mind as I zigzag and dive and \nleap to avoid the fireballs. Each one is only the size of an ap-\nple, but packs tremendous power on contact. Every sense I \nhave goes into overdrive as the need to survive takes over. \nThere\u2019s no time to judge if a move is the correct one. When \nthere\u2019s a hiss, I act or die. \n\nSomething keeps me moving forward, though. A lifetime of \nwatching the Hunger Games lets me know that certain areas \nof the arena are rigged for certain attacks. And that if I can just \nget away from this section, I might be able to move out of \nreach of the launchers. I might also then fall straight into a pit \nof vipers, but I can\u2019t worry about that now. \n\nHow long I scramble along dodging the fireballs I can\u2019t say, \nbut the attacks finally begin to abate. Which is good, because \nI\u2019m retching again. This time it\u2019s an acidic substance that \nscalds my throat and makes its way into my nose as well. I\u2019m \n\n\n\n \n\n175 \n \n\nforced to stop as my body convulses, trying desperately to rid \nitself of the poisons I\u2019ve been sucking in during the attack. I \nwait for the next hiss, the next signal to bolt. It doesn\u2019t come. \nThe force of the retching has squeezed tears out of my sting-\ning eyes. My clothes are drenched in sweat. Somehow, \nthrough the smoke and vomit, I pick up the scent of singed \nhair. My hand fumbles to my braid and finds a fireball has \nseared off at least six inches of it. Strands of blackened hair \ncrumble in my fingers. I stare at them, fascinated by the trans-\nformation, when the hissing registers. \n\nMy muscles react, only not fast enough this time. The fire-\nball crashes into the ground at my side, but not before it skids \nacross my right calf. Seeing my pants leg on fire sends me over \nthe edge. I twist and scuttle backward on my hands and feet, \nshrieking, trying to remove myself from the horror. When I fi-\nnally regain enough sense, I roll the leg back and forth on the \nground, which stifles the worst of it. But then, without think-\ning, I rip away the remaining fabric with my bare hands. \n\nI sit on the ground, a few yards from the blaze set off by the \nfireball. My calf is screaming, my hands covered in red welts. \nI\u2019m shaking too hard to move. If the Gamemakers want to \nfinish me off, now is the time. \n\nI hear Cinna\u2019s voice, carrying images of rich fabric and \nsparkling gems. \u201cKatniss, the girl who was on fire.\u201d What a \ngood laugh the Gamemakers must be having over that one. \nPerhaps, Cinna\u2019s beautiful costumes have even brought on this \nparticular torture for me. I know he couldn\u2019t have foreseen \nthis, must be hurting for me because, in fact, I believe he cares \n\n\n\n \n\n176 \n \n\nabout me. But all in all, maybe showing up stark naked in that \nchariot would have been safer for me. \n\nThe attack is now over. The Gamemakers don\u2019t want me \ndead. Not yet anyway. Everyone knows they could destroy us \nall within seconds of the opening gong. The real sport of the \nHunger Games is watching the tributes kill one another. Every \nso often, they do kill a tribute just to remind the players they \ncan. But mostly, they manipulate us into confronting one \nanother face-to-face. Which means, if I am no longer being \nfired at, there is at least one other tribute close at hand. \n\nI would drag myself into a tree and take cover now if I \ncould, but the smoke is still thick enough to kill me. I make \nmyself stand and begin to limp away from the wall of flames \nthat lights up the sky. It does not seem to be pursuing me any \nlonger, except with its stinking black clouds. \n\nAnother light, daylight, begins to softly emerge. Swirls of \nsmoke catch the sunbeams. My visibility is poor. I can see \nmaybe fifteen yards in any direction. A tribute could easily be \nconcealed from me here. I should draw my knife as a precau-\ntion, but I doubt my ability to hold it for long. The pain in my \nhands can in no way compete with that in my calf. I hate \nburns, have always hated them, even a small one gotten from \npulling a pan of bread from the oven. It is the worst kind of \npain to me, but I have never experienced anything like this. \n\nI\u2019m so weary I don\u2019t even notice I\u2019m in the pool until I\u2019m \nankle-deep. It\u2019s spring-fed, bubbling up out of a crevice in \nsome rocks, and blissfully cool. I plunge my hands into the \nshallow water and feel instant relief. Isn\u2019t that what my moth-\n\n\n\n \n\n177 \n \n\ner always says? The first treatment for a burn is cold water? \nThat it draws out the heat? But she means minor burns. Prob-\nably she\u2019d recommend it for my hands. But what of my calf? \nAlthough I have not yet had the courage to examine it, I\u2019m \nguessing that it\u2019s an injury in a whole different class. \n\nI lie on my stomach at edge of the pool for a while, dangling \nmy hands in the water, examining the little flames on my fin-\ngernails that are beginning to chip off. Good. I\u2019ve had enough \nfire for a lifetime. \n\nI bathe the blood and ash from my face. I try to recall all I \nknow about burns. They are common injuries in the Seam \nwhere we cook and heat our homes with coal. Then there are \nthe mine accidents. . . . A family once brought in an uncons-\ncious young man pleading with my mother to help him. The \ndistrict doctor who\u2019s responsible for treating the miners had \nwritten him off, told the family to take him home to die. But \nthey wouldn\u2019t accept this. He lay on our kitchen table, sense-\nless to the world. I got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, \ngaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before I \nran from the house. I went to the woods and hunted the entire \nday, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my father\u2019s \ndeath. What\u2019s funny was, Prim, who\u2019s scared of her own sha-\ndow, stayed and helped. My mother says healers are born, not \nmade. They did their best, but the man died, just like the doc-\ntor said he would. \n\nMy leg is in need of attention, but I still can\u2019t look at it. \nWhat if it\u2019s as bad as the man\u2019s and I can see my bone? Then I \nremember my mother saying that if a burn\u2019s severe, the victim \n\n\n\n \n\n178 \n \n\nmight not even feel pain because the nerves would be de-\nstroyed. Encouraged by this, I sit up and swing my leg in front \nof me. \n\nI almost faint at the sight of my calf. The flesh is a brilliant \nred covered with blisters. I force myself to take deep, slow \nbreaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. I \ncan\u2019t show weakness at this injury. Not if I want help. Pity \ndoes not get you aid. Admiration at your refusal to give in \ndoes. I cut the remains of the pant leg off at the knee and ex-\namine the injury more closely. The burned area is about the \nsize of my hand. None of the skin is blackened. I think it\u2019s not \ntoo bad to soak. Gingerly I stretch out my leg into the pool, \npropping the heel of my boot on a rock so the leather doesn\u2019t \nget too sodden, and sigh, because this does offer some relief. I \nknow there are herbs, if I could find them, that would speed \nthe healing, but I can\u2019t quite call them to mind. Water and time \nwill probably be all I have to work with. \n\nShould I be moving on? The smoke is slowly clearing but \nstill too heavy to be healthy. If I do continue away from the \nfire, won\u2019t I be walking straight into the weapons of the Ca-\nreers? Besides, every time I lift my leg from the water, the \npain rebounds so intensely I have to slide it back in. My hands \nare slightly less demanding. They can handle small breaks \nfrom the pool. So I slowly put my gear back in order. First I fill \nmy bottle with the pool water, treat it, and when enough time \nhas passed, begin to rehydrate my body. After a time, I force \nmyself to nibble on a cracker, which helps settle my stomach. I \nroll up my sleeping bag. Except for a few black marks, it\u2019s rela-\n\n\n\n \n\n179 \n \n\ntively unscathed. My jacket\u2019s another matter. Stinking and \nscorched, at least a foot of the back beyond repair. I cut off the \ndamaged area leaving me with a garment that comes just to \nthe bottom of my ribs. But the hood\u2019s intact and it\u2019s far better \nthan nothing. \n\nDespite the pain, drowsiness begins to take over. I\u2019d take to \na tree and try to rest, except I\u2019d be too easy to spot. Besides, \nabandoning my pool seems impossible. I neatly arrange my \nsupplies, even settle my pack on my shoulders, but I can\u2019t \nseem to leave. I spot some water plants with edible roots and \nmake a small meal with my last piece of rabbit. Sip water. \nWatch the sun make its slow arc across the sky. Where would \nI go anyway that is any safer than here? I lean back on my \npack, overcome by drowsiness. If the Careers want me, let \n\nthem find me, I think before drifting into a stupor. Let them \n\nfind me. \n\nAnd find me, they do. It\u2019s lucky I\u2019m ready to move on be-\ncause when I hear the feet, I have less than a minute head \nstart. Evening has begun to fall. The moment I awake, I\u2019m up \nand running, splashing across the pool, flying into the under-\nbrush. My leg slows me down, but I sense my pursuers are not \nas speedy as they were before the fire, either. I hear their \ncoughs, their raspy voices calling to one another. \n\nStill, they are closing in, just like a pack of wild dogs, and so \nI do what I have done my whole life in such circumstances. I \npick a high tree and begin to climb. If running hurt, climbing is \nagonizing because it requires not only exertion but direct con-\ntact of my hands on the tree bark. I\u2019m fast, though, and by the \n\n\n\n \n\n180 \n \n\ntime they\u2019ve reached the base of my trunk, I\u2019m twenty feet up. \nFor a moment, we stop and survey one another. I hope they \ncan\u2019t hear the pounding of my heart. \n\nThis could be it, I think. What chance do I have against \nthem? All six are there, the five Careers and Peeta, and my on-\nly consolation is they\u2019re pretty beat-up, too. Even so, look at \ntheir weapons. Look at their faces, grinning and snarling at \nme, a sure kill above them. It seems pretty hopeless. But then \nsomething else registers. They\u2019re bigger and stronger than I \nam, no doubt, but they\u2019re also heavier. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s me \nand not Gale who ventures up to pluck the highest fruit, or rob \nthe most remote bird nests. I must weigh at least fifty or sixty \npounds less than the smallest Career. \n\nNow I smile. \u201cHow\u2019s everything with you?\u201d I call down \ncheerfully. \n\nThis takes them aback, but I know the crowd will love it. \n\u201cWell enough,\u201d says the boy from District 2. \u201cYourself?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit warm for my taste,\u201d I say. I can almost hear \n\nthe laughter from the Capitol. \u201cThe air\u2019s better up here. Why \ndon\u2019t you come on up?\u201d \n\n\u201cThink I will,\u201d says the same boy. \n\u201cHere, take this, Cato,\u201d says the girl from District 1, and she \n\noffers him the silver bow and sheath of arrows. My bow! My \narrows! Just the sight of them makes me so angry I want to \nscream, at myself, at that traitor Peeta for distracting me from \nhaving them. I try to make eye contact with him now, but he \nseems to be intentionally avoiding my gaze as he polishes his \nknife with the edge of his shirt. \n\n\n\n \n\n181 \n \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Cato, pushing away the bow. \u201cI\u2019ll do better with \nmy sword.\u201d I can see the weapon, a short, heavy blade at his \nbelt. \n\nI give Cato time to hoist himself into the tree before I begin \nto climb again. Gale always says I remind him of a squirrel the \nway I can scurry up even the slenderest limb. Part of it\u2019s my \nweight, but part of it\u2019s practice. You have to know where to \nplace your hands and feet. I\u2019m another thirty feet in the air \nwhen I hear the crack and look down to see Cato flailing as he \nand a branch go down. He hits the ground hard and I\u2019m hoping \nhe possibly broke his neck when he gets back to his feet, \nswearing like a fiend. \n\nThe girl with the arrows, Glimmer I hear someone call her \n\u2014 ugh, the names the people in District 1 give their children \nare so ridiculous \u2014 anyway Glimmer scales the tree until the \nbranches begin to crack under her feet and then has the good \nsense to stop. I\u2019m at least eighty feet high now. She tries to \nshoot me and it\u2019s immediately evident that she\u2019s incompetent \nwith a bow. One of the arrows gets lodged in the tree near me \nthough and I\u2019m able to seize it. I wave it teasingly above her \nhead, as if this was the sole purpose of retrieving it, when ac-\ntually I mean to use it if I ever get the chance. I could kill them, \neveryone of them, if those silver weapons were in my hands. \n\nThe Careers regroup on the ground and I can hear them \ngrowling conspiratorially among themselves, furious I have \nmade them look foolish. But twilight has arrived and their \nwindow of attack on me is closing. Finally, I hear Peeta say \n\n\n\n \n\n182 \n \n\nharshly, \u201cOh, let her stay up there. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going an-\nywhere. We\u2019ll deal with her in the morning.\u201d \n\nWell, he\u2019s right about one thing. I\u2019m going nowhere. All the \nrelief from the pool water has gone, leaving me to feel the full \npotency of my burns. I scoot down to a fork in the tree and \nclumsily prepare for bed. Put on my jacket. Lay out my sleep-\ning bed. Belt myself in and try to keep from moaning. The heat \nof the bag\u2019s too much for my leg. I cut a slash in the fabric and \nhang my calf out in the open air. I drizzle water on the wound, \nmy hands. \n\nAll my bravado is gone. I\u2019m weak from pain and hunger but \ncan\u2019t bring myself to eat. Even if I can last the night, what will \nthe morning bring? I stare into the foliage trying to will myself \nto rest, but the burns forbid it. Birds are settling down for the \nnight, singing lullabies to their young. Night creatures emerge. \nAn owl hoots. The faint scent of a skunk cuts through the \nsmoke. The eyes of some animal peer at me from the neigh-\nboring tree \u2014 a possum maybe \u2014 catching the firelight from \nthe Careers\u2019 torches. Suddenly, I\u2019m up on one elbow. Those \nare no possum\u2019s eyes, I know their glassy reflection too well. \nIn fact, those are not animal eyes at all. In the last dim rays of \nlight, I make her out, watching me silently from between the \nbranches. Rue. \n\nHow long has she been here? The whole time probably. Still \nand unobserved as the action unfolded beneath her. Perhaps \nshe headed up her tree shortly before I did, hearing the pack \nwas so close. \n\n\n\n \n\n183 \n \n\nFor a while we hold each other\u2019s gaze. Then, without even \nrustling a leaf, her little hand slides into the open and points \nto something above my head. \n\n\n\n \n\n184 \n \n\n \n \n \nMy eyes follow the line of her finger up into the foliage \n\nabove me. At first, I have no idea what she\u2019s pointing to, but \nthen, about fifteen feet up, I make out the vague shape in the \ndimming light. But of . . . of what? Some sort of animal? It looks \nabout the size of a raccoon, but it hangs from the bottom of a \nbranch, swaying ever so slightly. There\u2019s something else. \nAmong the familiar evening sounds of the woods, my ears reg-\nister a low hum. Then I know. It\u2019s a wasp nest. \n\nFear shoots through me, but I have enough sense to keep \nstill. After all, I don\u2019t know what kind of wasp lives there. It \ncould be the ordinary leave-us-alone-and-we\u2019ll-leave-you-\nalone type. But these are the Hunger Games, and ordinary isn\u2019t \nthe norm. More likely they will be one of the Capitol\u2019s mutta-\ntions, tracker jackers. Like the jabberjays, these killer wasps \nwere spawned in a lab and strategically placed, like land \nmines, around the districts during the war. Larger than regu-\nlar wasps, they have a distinctive solid gold body and a sting \nthat raises a lump the size of a plum on contact. Most people \ncan\u2019t tolerate more than a few stings. Some die at once. If you \nlive, the hallucinations brought on by the venom have actually \ndriven people to madness. And there\u2019s another thing, these \nwasps will hunt down anyone who disturbs their nest and at-\n\n\n\n \n\n185 \n \n\ntempt to kill them. That\u2019s where the tracker part of the name \ncomes from. \n\nAfter the war, the Capitol destroyed all the nests surround-\ning their city, but the ones near the districts were left un-\ntouched. Another reminder of our weakness, I suppose, just \nlike the Hunger Games. Another reason to keep inside the \nfence of District 12. When Gale and I come across a tracker \njacker nest, we immediately head in the opposite direction. \n\nSo is that what hangs above me? I look back to Rue for help, \nbut she\u2019s melted into her tree. \n\nGiven my circumstances, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter what \ntype of wasp nest it is. I\u2019m wounded and trapped. Darkness \nhas given me a brief reprieve, but by the time the sun rises, \nthe Careers will have formulated a plan to kill me. There\u2019s no \nway they could do otherwise after I\u2019ve made them look so \nstupid. That nest may be the sole option I have left. If I can \ndrop it down on them, I may be able to escape. But I\u2019ll risk my \nlife in the process. \n\nOf course, I\u2019ll never be able to get in close enough to the ac-\ntual nest to cut it free. I\u2019ll have to saw off the branch at the \ntrunk and send the whole thing down. The serrated portion of \nmy knife should be able to manage that. But can my hands? \nAnd will the vibration from the sawing raise the swarm? And \nwhat if the Careers figure out what I\u2019m doing and move their \ncamp? That would defeat the whole purpose. \n\nI realize that the best chance I\u2019ll have to do the sawing \nwithout drawing notice will be during the anthem. That could \nbegin any time. I drag myself out of my bag, make sure my \n\n\n\n \n\n186 \n \n\nknife is secured in my belt, and begin to make my way up the \ntree. This in itself is dangerous since the branches are becom-\ning precariously thin even for me, but I persevere. When I \nreach the limb that supports the nest, the humming becomes \nmore distinctive. But it\u2019s still oddly subdued if these are track-\ner jackers. It\u2019s the smoke, I think. It\u2019s sedated them. This was \nthe one defense the rebels found to battle the wasps. \n\nThe seal of the Capitol shines above me and the anthem \nblares out. It\u2019s now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Blisters \nburst on my right hand as I awkwardly drag the knife back \nand forth. Once I\u2019ve got a groove, the work requires less effort \nbut is almost more than I can handle. I grit my teeth and saw \naway occasionally glancing at the sky to register that there \nwere no deaths today. That\u2019s all right. The audience will be \nsated seeing me injured and treed and the pack below me. But \nthe anthem\u2019s running out and I\u2019m only three quarters of the \nway through the wood when the music ends, the sky goes \ndark, and I\u2019m forced to stop. \n\nNow what? I could probably finish off the job by sense of \nfeel but that may not be the smartest plan. If the wasps are too \ngroggy, if the nest catches on its way down, if I try to escape, \nthis could all be a deadly waste of time. Better, I think, to \nsneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies. \n\nIn the faint light of the Careers\u2019 torches, I inch back down to \nmy fork to find the best surprise I\u2019ve ever had. Sitting on my \nsleeping bag is a small plastic pot attached to a silver para-\nchute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it \nsent in during the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my \n\n\n\n \n\n187 \n \n\nhand. What can it be? Not food surely. I unscrew the lid and I \nknow by the scent that it\u2019s medicine. Cautiously, I probe the \nsurface of the ointment. The throbbing in my fingertip vanish-\nes. \n\n\u201cOh, Haymitch,\u201d I whisper. \u201cThank you.\u201d He has not aban-\ndoned me. Not left me to fend entirely for myself. The cost of \nthis medicine must be astronomical. Probably not one but \nmany sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. To \nme, it is priceless. \n\nI dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over \nmy calf. The effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on con-\ntact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. This is no \nherbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland \nplants, it\u2019s high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol\u2019s labs. \nWhen my calf is treated, I rub a thin layer into my hands. After \nwrapping the pot in the parachute, I nestle it safely away in \nmy pack. Now that the pain has eased, it\u2019s all I can do to repo-\nsition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep. \n\nA bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new \nday is dawning. In the gray morning light, I examine my hands. \nThe medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to a \nsoft baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that burn \nwas far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly \npack up my gear. Whatever happens, I\u2019m going to have to \nmove and move fast. I also make myself eat a cracker and a \nstrip of beef and drink a few cups of water. \n\nAlmost nothing stayed in my stomach yesterday, and I\u2019m \nalready starting to feel the effects of hunger. \n\n\n\n \n\n188 \n \n\nBelow me, I can see the Career pack and Peeta asleep on \nthe ground. By her position, leaning up against the trunk of \nthe tree, I\u2019d guess Glimmer was supposed to be on guard, but \nfatigue overcame her. \n\nMy eyes squint as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, \nbut I can\u2019t make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only seems \nfair to warn her. Besides, if I\u2019m going to die today, it\u2019s Rue I \nwant to win. Even if it means a little extra food for my family, \nthe idea of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. \n\nI call Rue\u2019s name in a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, \nwide and alert, at once. She points up to the nest again. I hold \nup my knife and make a sawing motion. She nods and disap-\npears. There\u2019s a rustling in a nearby tree. Then the same noise \nagain a bit farther off. I realize she\u2019s leaping from tree to tree. \nIt\u2019s all I can do not to laugh out loud. Is this what she showed \nthe Gamemakers? I imagine her flying around the training \nequipment never touching the floor. She should have gotten at \nleast a ten. \n\nRosy streaks are breaking through in the east. I can\u2019t afford \nto wait any longer. Compared to the agony of last night\u2019s \nclimb, this one is a cinch. At the tree limb that holds the nest, I \nposition the knife in the groove and I\u2019m about to draw the \nteeth across the wood when I see something moving. There, \non the nest. The bright gold gleam of a tracker jacker lazily \nmaking its way across the papery gray surface. No question, \nit\u2019s acting a little subdued, but the wasp is up and moving and \nthat means the others will be out soon as well. Sweat breaks \nout on the palms of my hands, beading up through the oint-\n\n\n\n \n\n189 \n \n\nment, and I do my best to pat them dry on my shirt. If I don\u2019t \nget through this branch in a matter of seconds, the entire \nswarm could emerge and attack me. \n\nThere\u2019s no sense in putting it off. I take a deep breath, grip \nthe knife handle and bear down as hard as I can. Back, forth, \n\nback, forth! The tracker jackers begin to buzz and I hear them \ncoming out. Back, forth, back, forth! A stabbing pain shoots \nthrough my knee and I know one has found me and the others \nwill be honing in. Back, forth, back, forth. And just as the knife \ncuts through, I shove the end of the branch as far away from \nme as I can. It crashes down through the lower branches, \nsnagging temporarily on a few but then twisting free until it \nsmashes with a thud on the ground. The nest bursts open like \nan egg, and a furious swarm of tracker jackers takes to the air. \n\nI feel a second sting on the cheek, a third on my neck, and \ntheir venom almost immediately makes me woozy. I cling to \nthe tree with one arm while I rip the barbed stingers out of my \nflesh. Fortunately, only these three tracker jackers had identi-\nfied me before the nest went down. The rest of the insects \nhave targeted their enemies on the ground. \n\nIt\u2019s mayhem. The Careers have woken to a full-scale tracker \njacker attack. Peeta and a few others have the sense to drop \neverything and bolt. I can hear cries of \u201cTo the lake! To the \nlake!\u201d and know they hope to evade the wasps by taking to the \nwater. It must be close if they think they can outdistance the \nfurious insects. Glimmer and another girl, the one from Dis-\ntrict 4, are not so lucky. They receive multiple stings before \nthey\u2019re even out of my view. Glimmer appears to go complete-\n\n\n\n \n\n190 \n \n\nly mad, shrieking and trying to bat the wasps off with her bow, \nwhich is pointless. She calls to the others for help but, of \ncourse, no one returns. The girl from District 4 staggers out of \nsight, although I wouldn\u2019t bet on her making it to the lake. I \nwatch Glimmer fall, twitch hysterically around on the ground \nfor a few minutes, and then go still. \n\nThe nest is nothing but an empty shell. The wasps have va-\nnished in pursuit of the others. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll return, but \nI don\u2019t want to risk it. I scamper down the tree and hit the \nground running in the opposite direction of the lake. The poi-\nson from the stingers makes me wobbly, but I find my way \nback to my own little pool and submerge myself in the water, \njust in case any wasps are still on my trail. After about five \nminutes, I drag myself onto the rocks. People have not exagge-\nrated the effects of the tracker jacker stings. Actually, the one \non my knee is closer to an orange than a plum in size. A foul-\nsmelling green liquid oozes from the places where I pulled out \nthe stingers. \n\nThe swelling. The pain. The ooze. Watching Glimmer \ntwitching to death on the ground. It\u2019s a lot to handle before \nthe sun has even cleared the horizon. I don\u2019t want to think \nabout what Glimmer must look like now. Her body disfigured. \nHer swollen fingers stiffening around the bow . . . \n\nThe bow! Somewhere in my befuddled mind one thought \nconnects to another and I\u2019m on my feet, teetering through the \ntrees back to Glimmer. The bow. The arrows. I must get them. \nI haven\u2019t heard the cannons fire yet, so perhaps Glimmer is in \nsome sort of coma, her heart still struggling against the wasp \n\n\n\n \n\n191 \n \n\nvenom. But once it stops and the cannon signals her death, a \nhovercraft will move in and retrieve her body, taking the only \nbow and sheath of arrows I\u2019ve seen out of the Games for good. \nAnd I refuse to let them slip through my fingers again! \n\nI reach Glimmer just as the cannon fires. The tracker jack-\ners have vanished. This girl, so breathtakingly beautiful in her \ngolden dress the night of the interviews, is unrecognizable. \nHer features eradicated, her limbs three times their normal \nsize. The stinger lumps have begun to explode, spewing putrid \ngreen liquid around her. I have to break several of what used \nto be her fingers with a stone to free the bow. The sheath of \narrows is pinned under her back. I try to roll over her body by \npulling on one arm, but the flesh disintegrates in my hands \nand I fall back on the ground. \n\nIs this real? Or have the hallucinations begun? I squeeze my \neyes tight and try to breathe through my mouth, ordering my-\nself not to become sick. Breakfast must stay down, it might be \ndays before I can hunt again. A second cannon fires and I\u2019m \nguessing the girl from District 4 has just died. I hear the birds \nfall silent and then one give the warning call, which means a \nhovercraft is about to appear. Confused, I think it\u2019s for Glim-\nmer, although this doesn\u2019t quite make sense because I\u2019m still \nin the picture, still fighting for the arrows. I lurch back onto \nmy knees and the trees around me begin to spin in circles. In \nthe middle of the sky, I spot the hovercraft. I throw myself \nover Glimmer\u2019s body as if to protect it but then I see the girl \nfrom District 4 being lifted into the air and vanishing. \n\n\n\n \n\n192 \n \n\n\u201cDo this!\u201d I command myself. Clenching my jaw, I dig my \nhands under Glimmer\u2019s body, get a hold on what must be her \nrib cage, and force her onto her stomach. I can\u2019t help it, I\u2019m \nhyperventilating now, the whole thing is so nightmarish and \nI\u2019m losing my grasp on what\u2019s real. I tug on the silver sheath of \narrows, but it\u2019s caught on something, her shoulder blade, \nsomething, and finally yank it free. I\u2019ve just encircled the \nsheath with my arms when I hear the footsteps, several pairs, \ncoming through the underbrush, and I realize the Careers \nhave come back. They\u2019ve come back to kill me or get their \nweapons or both. \n\nBut it\u2019s too late to run. I pull a slimy arrow from the sheath \nand try to position it on the bowstring but instead of one \nstring I see three and the stench from the stings is so repulsive \nI can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it. \n\nI\u2019m helpless as the first hunter crashes through the trees, \nspear lifted, poised to throw. The shock on Peeta\u2019s face makes \nno sense to me. I wait for the blow. Instead his arm drops to \nhis side. \n\n\u201cWhat are you still doing here?\u201d he hisses at me. I stare un-\ncomprehendingly as a trickle of water drips off a sting under \nhis ear. His whole body starts sparkling as if he\u2019s been dipped \nin dew. \u201cAre you mad?\u201d He\u2019s prodding me with the shaft of the \nspear now. \u201cGet up! Get up!\u201d I rise, but he\u2019s still pushing at me. \nWhat? What is going on? He shoves me away from him hard. \n\u201cRun!\u201d he screams. \u201cRun!\u201d \n\nBehind him, Cato slashes his way through the brush. He\u2019s \nsparkling wet, too, and badly stung under one eye. I catch the \n\n\n\n \n\n193 \n \n\ngleam of sunlight on his sword and do as Peeta says. Holding \ntightly to my bow and arrows, banging into trees that appear \nout of nowhere, tripping and falling as I try to keep my bal-\nance. Back past my pool and into unfamiliar woods. The world \nbegins to bend in alarming ways. A butterfly balloons to the \nsize of a house then shatters into a million stars. Trees trans-\nform to blood and splash down over my boots. Ants begin to \ncrawl out of the blisters on my hands and I can\u2019t shake them \nfree. They\u2019re climbing up my arms, my neck. Someone\u2019s \nscreaming, a long high pitched scream that never breaks for \nbreath. I have a vague idea it might be me. I trip and fall into a \nsmall pit lined with tiny orange bubbles that hum like the \ntracker jacker nest. Tucking my knees up to my chin, I wait for \ndeath. \n\nSick and disoriented, I\u2019m able to form only one thought: \nPeeta Mellark just saved my life. \n\nThen the ants bore into my eyes and I black out. \n\n\n\n \n\n194 \n \n\n  \n \n \nI enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to \n\nfind a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread most, \nall the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I \ncan\u2019t help but believe they\u2019re real. Each time I wake, I think, At \n\nlast, this is over, but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s only the beginning of a new \nchapter of torture. How many ways do I watch Prim die? Re-\nlive my father\u2019s last moments? Feel my own body ripped \napart? This is the nature of the tracker jacker venom, so care-\nfully created to target the place where fear lives in your brain. \n\nWhen I finally do come to my senses, I lie still, waiting for \nthe next onslaught of imagery. But eventually I accept that the \npoison must have finally worked its way out of my system, \nleaving my body wracked and feeble. I\u2019m still lying on my side, \nlocked in the fetal position. I lift a hand to my eyes to find \nthem sound, untouched by ants that never existed. Simply \nstretching out my limbs requires an enormous effort. So many \nparts of me hurt, it doesn\u2019t seem worthwhile taking inventory \nof them. Very, very slowly I manage to sit up. I\u2019m in a shallow \nhole, not filled with the humming orange bubbles of my hallu-\ncination but with old, dead leaves. My clothing\u2019s damp, but I \ndon\u2019t know whether pond water, dew, rain, or sweat is the \ncause. For a long time, all I can do is take tiny sips from my \n\n\n\n \n\n195 \n \n\nbottle and watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle \nbush. \n\nHow long have I been out? It was morning when I lost rea-\nson. Now it\u2019s afternoon. But the stiffness in my joints suggests \nmore than a day has passed, even two possibly. If so, I\u2019ll have \nno way of knowing which tributes survived that tracker jacker \nattack. Not Glimmer or the girl from District 4. But there was \nthe boy from District 1, both tributes from District 2, and Pee-\nta. Did they die from the stings? Certainly if they lived, their \nlast days must have been as horrid as my own. And what \nabout Rue? She\u2019s so small, it wouldn\u2019t take much venom to do \nher in. But then again . . . the tracker jackers would\u2019ve had to \ncatch her, and she had a good head start. \n\nA foul, rotten taste pervades my mouth, and the water has \nlittle effect on it. I drag myself over to the honeysuckle bush \nand pluck a flower. I gently pull the stamen through the blos-\nsom and set the drop of nectar on my tongue. The sweetness \nspreads through my mouth, down my throat, warming my \nveins with memories of summer, and my home woods and \nGale\u2019s presence beside me. For some reason, our discussion \nfrom that last morning comes back to me. \n\n\u201cWe could do it, you know.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\u201cLeave the district. Run off. Live in the woods. You and I, we \n\ncould make it.\u201d \n\nAnd suddenly, I\u2019m not thinking of Gale but of Peeta and . . . \nPeeta! He saved my life! I think. Because by the time we met \nup, I couldn\u2019t tell what was real and what the tracker jacker \n\n\n\n \n\n196 \n \n\nvenom had caused me to imagine. But if he did, and my in-\nstincts tell me he did, what for? Is he simply working the Lov-\ner Boy angle he initiated at the interview? Or was he actually \ntrying to protect me? And if he was, what was he doing with \nthose Careers in the first place? None of it makes sense. \n\nI wonder what Gale made of the incident for a moment and \nthen I push the whole thing out of my mind because for some \nreason Gale and Peeta do not coexist well together in my \nthoughts. \n\nSo I focus on the one really good thing that\u2019s happened \nsince I landed in the arena. I have a bow and arrows! A full \ndozen arrows if you count the one I retrieved in the tree. They \nbear no trace of the noxious green slime that came from \nGlimmer\u2019s body \u2014 which leads me to believe that might not \nhave been wholly real \u2014 but they have a fair amount of dried \nblood on them. I can clean them later, but I do take a minute to \nshoot a few into a nearby tree. They are more like the wea-\npons in the Training Center than my ones at home, but who \ncares? That I can work with. \n\nThe weapons give me an entirely new perspective on the \nGames. I know I have tough opponents left to face. But I am no \nlonger merely prey that runs and hides or takes desperate \nmeasures. If Cato broke through the trees right now, I \nwouldn\u2019t flee, I\u2019d shoot. I find I\u2019m actually anticipating the \nmoment with pleasure. \n\nBut first, I have to get some strength back in my body. I\u2019m \nvery dehydrated again and my water supply is dangerously \nlow. The little padding I was able to put on by gorging myself \n\n\n\n \n\n197 \n \n\nduring prep time in the Capitol is gone, plus several more \npounds as well. My hip bones and ribs are more prominent \nthan I remember them being since those awful months after \nmy father\u2019s death. And then there are my wounds to contend \nwith \u2014 burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, \nand three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen \nas ever. I treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a \nbit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. My \nmother knew a treatment for them, some type of leaf that \ncould draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it, \nand I don\u2019t even remember its name let alone its appearance. \n\nWater first, I think. You can hunt along the way now. It\u2019s \neasy to see the direction I came from by the path of destruc-\ntion my crazed body made through the foliage. So I walk off in \nthe other direction, hoping my enemies still lie locked in the \nsurreal world of tracker jacker venom. \n\nI can\u2019t move too quickly, my joints reject any abrupt mo-\ntions. But I establish the slow hunter\u2019s tread I use when track-\ning game. Within a few minutes, I spot a rabbit and make my \nfirst kill with the bow and arrow. It\u2019s not my usual clean shot \nthrough the eye, but I\u2019ll take it. After about an hour, I find a \nstream, shallow but wide, and more than sufficient for my \nneeds. The sun\u2019s hot and severe, so while I wait for my water \nto purify I strip down to my underclothes and wade into the \nmild current. I\u2019m filthy from head to toe, I try splashing myself \nbut eventually just lay down in the water for a few minutes, \nletting it wash off the soot and blood and skin that has started \nto peel off my burns. After rinsing out my clothes and hanging \n\n\n\n \n\n198 \n \n\nthem on bushes to dry, I sit on the bank in the sun for a bit, \nuntangling my hair with my fingers. My appetite returns and I \neat a cracker and a strip of beef. With a handful of moss, I \npolish the blood from my silver weapons. \n\nRefreshed, I treat my burns again, braid back my hair, and \ndress in the damp clothes, knowing the sun will dry them soon \nenough. Following the stream against its current seems the \nsmartest course of action. I\u2019m traveling uphill now, which I \nprefer, with a source of fresh water not only for myself but \npossible game. I easily take out a strange bird that must be \nsome form of wild turkey. Anyway, it looks plenty edible to \nme. By late afternoon, I decide to build a small fire to cook the \nmeat, betting that dusk will help conceal the smoke and I can \nquench the fire by nightfall. I clean the game, taking extra care \nwith the bird, but there\u2019s nothing alarming about it. Once the \nfeathers are plucked, it\u2019s no bigger than a chicken, but it\u2019s \nplump and firm. I\u2019ve just placed the first lot over the coals \nwhen I hear the twig snap. \n\nIn one motion, I turn to the sound, bringing the bow and ar-\nrow to my shoulder. There\u2019s no one there. No one I can see \nanyway. Then I spot the tip of a child\u2019s boot just peeking out \nfrom behind the trunk of a tree. My shoulders relax and I grin. \nShe can move through the woods like a shadow, you have to \ngive her that. How else could she have followed me? The \nwords come out of my mouth before I can stop them. \n\n\u201cYou know, they\u2019re not the only ones who can form al-\nliances,\u201d I say. \n\n\n\n \n\n199 \n \n\nFor a moment, no response. Then one of Rue\u2019s eyes edges \naround the trunk. \u201cYou want me for an ally?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy not? You saved me with those tracker jackers. You\u2019re \nsmart enough to still be alive. And I can\u2019t seem to shake you \nanyway,\u201d I say. She blinks at me, trying to decide. \u201cYou hun-\ngry?\u201d I can see her swallow hard, her eye flickering to the \nmeat. \u201cCome on then, I\u2019ve had two kills today.\u201d \n\nRue tentatively steps out into the open. \u201cI can fix your \nstings.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan you?\u201d I ask. \u201cHow?\u201d \nShe digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of \n\nleaves. I\u2019m almost certain they\u2019re the ones my mother uses. \n\u201cWhere\u2019d you find those?\u201d \n\n\u201cJust around. We all carry them when we work in the orc-\nhards. They left a lot of nests there,\u201d says Rue. \u201cThere are a lot \nhere, too.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re District Eleven. Agriculture,\u201d I say. \n\u201cOrchards, huh? That must be how you can fly around the \ntrees like you\u2019ve got wings.\u201d Rue smiles. I\u2019ve landed on one of \nthe few things she\u2019ll admit pride in. \u201cWell, come on, then. Fix \nme up.\u201d \n\nI plunk down by the fire and roll up my pant leg to reveal \nthe sting on my knee. To my surprise, Rue places the handful \nof leaves into her mouth and begins to chew them. My mother \nwould use other methods, but it\u2019s not like we have a lot of op-\ntions. After a minute or so, Rue presses a gloppy green wad of \nchewed leaves and spit on my knee. \n\n\n\n \n\n200 \n \n\n\u201cOhhh.\u201d The sound comes out of my mouth before I can \nstop it. It\u2019s as if the leaves are actually leaching the pain right \nout of the sting. \n\nRue gives a giggle. \u201cLucky you had the sense to pull the \nstingers out or you\u2019d be a lot worse.\u201d \n\n\u201cDo my neck! Do my cheek!\u201d I almost beg. \nRue stuffs another handful of leaves in her mouth, and soon \n\nI\u2019m laughing because the relief is so sweet. I notice a long burn \non Rue\u2019s forearm. \u201cI\u2019ve got something for that.\u201d I set aside my \nweapons and anoint her arm with the burn medicine. \n\n\u201cYou have good sponsors,\u201d she says longingly. \n\u201cHave you gotten anything yet?\u201d I ask. She shakes her head. \n\n\u201cYou will, though. Watch. The closer we get to the end, the \nmore people will realize how clever you are.\u201d I turn the meat \nover. \n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t joking, about wanting me for an ally?\u201d she \nasks. \n\n\u201cNo, I meant it,\u201d I say. I can almost hear Haymitch groaning \nas I team up with this wispy child. But I want her. Because \nshe\u2019s a survivor, and I trust her, and why not admit it? She \nreminds me of Prim. \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she says, and holds out her hand. We shake. \u201cIt\u2019s a \ndeal.\u201d \n\nOf course, this kind of deal can only be temporary, but nei-\nther of us mentions that. \n\nRue contributes a big handful of some sort of starchy root \nto the meal. Roasted over the fire, they have the sharp sweet \ntaste of a parsnip. She recognizes the bird, too, some wild \n\n\n\n \n\n201 \n \n\nthing they call a groosling in her district. She says sometimes a \nflock will wander into the orchard and they get a decent lunch \nthat day. For a while, all conversation stops as we fill our sto-\nmachs. The groosling has delicious meal that\u2019s so fatty, the \ngrease drips down your face when you bite into it. \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Rue with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a whole leg to \nmyself before.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ll bet she hasn\u2019t. I\u2019ll bet meat hardly ever comes her way. \n\u201cTake the other,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cReally?\u201d she asks. \n\u201cTake whatever you want. Now that I\u2019ve got a bow and ar-\n\nrows, I can get more. Plus I\u2019ve got snares. I can show you how \nto set them,\u201d I say. Rue still looks uncertainly at the leg. \u201cOh, \ntake it,\u201d I say, putting the drumstick in her hands. \u201cIt will only \nkeep a few days anyway, and we\u2019ve got the whole bird plus \nthe rabbit.\u201d Once she\u2019s got hold of it, her appetite wins out and \nshe takes a huge mouthful. \n\n\u201cI\u2019d have thought, in District Eleven, you\u2019d have a bit more \nto eat than us. You know, since you grow the food,\u201d I say. \n\nRue\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cOh, no, we\u2019re not allowed to eat the \ncrops.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey arrest you or something?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThey whip you and make everyone else watch,\u201d says Rue. \n\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s very strict about it.\u201d \nI can tell by her expression that it\u2019s not that uncommon an \n\noccurrence. A public whipping\u2019s a rare thing in District 12, al-\nthough occasionally one occurs. Technically, Gale and I could \nbe whipped on a daily basis for poaching in the woods \u2014 well, \n\n\n\n \n\n202 \n \n\ntechnically, we could get a whole lot worse \u2014 except all the \nofficials buy our meat. Besides, our mayor, Madge\u2019s father, \ndoesn\u2019t seem to have much taste for such events. Maybe being \nthe least prestigious, poorest, most ridiculed district in the \ncountry has its advantages. Such as, being largely ignored by \nthe Capitol as long as we produce our coal quotas. \n\n\u201cDo you get all the coal you want?\u201d Rue asks. \n\u201cNo,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust what we buy and whatever we track in \n\non our boots.\u201d \n\u201cThey feed us a bit extra during harvest, so that people can \n\nkeep going longer,\u201d says Rue. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you have to be in school?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNot during harvest. Everyone works then,\u201d says Rue. \nIt\u2019s interesting, hearing about her life. We have so little \n\ncommunication with anyone outside our district. In fact, I \nwonder if the Gamemakers are blocking out our conversation, \nbecause even though the information seems harmless, they \ndon\u2019t want people in different districts to know about one \nanother. \n\nAt Rue\u2019s suggestion, we lay out all our food to plan ahead. \nShe\u2019s seen most of mine, but I add the last couple of crackers \nand beef strips to the pile. She\u2019s gathered quite a collection of \nroots, nuts, greens, and even some berries. \n\nI roll an unfamiliar berry in my fingers. \u201cYou sure this is \nsafe?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, yes, we have them back home. I\u2019ve been eating them \nfor days,\u201d she says, popping a handful in her mouth. I tenta-\ntively bite into one, and it\u2019s as good as our blackberries. Tak-\n\n\n\n \n\n203 \n \n\ning Rue on as an ally seems a better choice all the time. We di-\nvide up our food supplies, so in case we\u2019re separated, we\u2019ll \nboth be set for a few days. Apart from the food, Rue has a \nsmall water skin, a homemade slingshot, and an extra pair of \nsocks. She also has a sharp shard of rock she uses as a knife. \u201cI \nknow it\u2019s not much,\u201d she says as if embarrassed, \u201cbut I had to \nget away from the Cornucopia fast.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou did just right,\u201d I say. When I spread out my gear, she \ngasps a little when she sees the sunglasses. \n\n\u201cHow did you get those?\u201d she asks. \n\u201cIn my pack. They\u2019ve been useless so far. They don\u2019t block \n\nthe sun and they make it harder to see,\u201d I say with a shrug. \n\u201cThese aren\u2019t for sun, they\u2019re for darkness,\u201d exclaims Rue. \n\n\u201cSometimes, when we harvest through the night, they\u2019ll pass \nout a few pairs to those of us highest in the trees. Where the \ntorchlight doesn\u2019t reach. One time, this boy Martin, he tried to \nkeep his pair. Hid it in his pants. They killed him on the spot.\u201d \n\n\u201cThey killed a boy for taking these?\u201d I say. \n\u201cYes, and everyone knew he was no danger. Martin wasn\u2019t \n\nright in the head. I mean, he still acted like a three-year-old. \nHe just wanted the glasses to play with,\u201d says Rue. \n\nHearing this makes me feel like District 12 is some sort of \nsafe haven. Of course, people keel over from starvation all the \ntime, but I can\u2019t imagine the Peacekeepers murdering a sim-\npleminded child. There\u2019s a little girl, one of Greasy Sae\u2019s \ngrandkids, who wanders around the Hob. She\u2019s not quite right, \nbut she\u2019s treated as a sort of pet. People toss her scraps and \nthings. \n\n\n\n \n\n204 \n \n\n\u201cSo what do these do?\u201d I ask Rue, taking the glasses. \n\u201cThey let you see in complete darkness,\u201d says Rue. \u201cTry \n\nthem tonight when the sun goes down.\u201d \nI give Rue some matches and she makes sure I have plenty \n\nof leaves in case my stings flare up again. We extinguish our \nfire and head upstream until it\u2019s almost nightfall. \n\n\u201cWhere do you sleep?\u201d I ask her. \u201cIn the trees?\u201d She nods. \n\u201cIn just your jacket?\u201d \n\nRue holds up her extra pair of socks. \u201cI have these for my \nhands.\u201d \n\nI think of how cold the nights have been. \u201cYou can share my \nsleeping bag if you want. We\u2019ll both easily fit.\u201d Her face lights \nup. I can tell this is more than she dared hope for. \n\nWe pick a fork high in a tree and settle in for the night just \nas the anthem begins to play. There were no deaths today. \n\n\u201cRue, I only woke up today. How many nights did I miss?\u201d \nThe anthem should block out our words, but still I whisper. I \neven take the precaution of covering my lips with my hand. I \ndon\u2019t want the audience to know what I\u2019m planning to tell her \nabout Peeta. Taking a cue from me, she does the same. \n\n\u201cTwo,\u201d she says. \u201cThe girls from Districts One and Four are \ndead. There\u2019s ten of us left.\u201d \n\n\u201cSomething strange happened. At least, I think it did. It \nmight have been the tracker jacker venom making me imagine \nthings,\u201d I say. \u201cYou know the boy from my district? Peeta? I \nthink he saved my life. But he was with the Careers.\u201d \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not with them now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve spied on their \nbase camp by the lake. They made it back before they col-\n\n\n\n \n\n205 \n \n\nlapsed from the stingers. But he\u2019s not there. Maybe he did save \nyou and had to run.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t answer. If, in fact, Peeta did save me, I\u2019m in his debt \nagain. And this can\u2019t be paid back. \u201cIf he did, it was all proba-\nbly just part of his act. You know, to make people think he\u2019s in \nlove with me.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Rue thoughtfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was an act.\u201d \n\u201cCourse it is,\u201d I say. \u201cHe worked it out with our mentor.\u201d \n\nThe anthem ends and the sky goes dark. \u201cLet\u2019s try out these \nglasses.\u201d I pull out the glasses and slip them on. Rue wasn\u2019t \nkidding. I can see everything from the leaves on the trees to a \nskunk strolling through the bushes a good fifty feet away. I \ncould kill it from here if I had a mind to. I could kill anyone. \n\n\u201cI wonder who else got a pair of these,\u201d I say. \n\u201cThe Careers have two pairs. But they\u2019ve got everything \n\ndown by the lake,\u201d Rue says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re so strong.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re strong, too,\u201d I say. \u201cJust in a different way.\u201d \n\u201cYou are. You can shoot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d \n\u201cYou can feed yourself. Can they?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to. They have all those supplies,\u201d Rue \n\nsays. \n\u201cSay they didn\u2019t. Say the supplies were gone. How long \n\nwould they last?\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s the Hunger Games, right?\u201d \n\u201cBut, Katniss, they\u2019re not hungry,\u201d says Rue. \n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not. That\u2019s the problem,\u201d I agree. And for the \n\nfirst time, I have a plan. A plan that isn\u2019t motivated by the \nneed for flight and evasion. An offensive plan. \u201cI think we\u2019re \ngoing to have to fix that, Rue.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n206 \n \n\n \n \n \nRue has decided to trust me wholeheartedly. I know this \n\nbecause as soon as the anthem finishes she snuggles up \nagainst me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings \nabout her, as I take no particular precautions. If she\u2019d wanted \nme dead, all she would have had to do was disappear from \nthat tree without pointing out the tracker jacker nest. Needl-\ning me, at the very back of my mind, is the obvious. Both of us \ncan\u2019t win these Games. But since the odds are still against ei-\nther of us surviving, I manage to ignore the thought. \n\nBesides, I\u2019m distracted by my latest idea about the Careers \nand their supplies. Somehow Rue and I must find a way to de-\nstroy their food. I\u2019m pretty sure feeding themselves will be a \ntremendous struggle. Traditionally, the Career tributes\u2019 strat-\negy is to get hold of all the food early on and work from there. \nThe years when they have not protected it well \u2014 one year a \npack of hideous reptiles destroyed it, another a Gamemakers\u2019 \nflood washed it away \u2014 those are usually the years that tri-\nbutes from other districts have won. That the Careers have \nbeen better red growing up is actually to their disadvantage, \nbecause they don\u2019t know how to be hungry. Not the way Rue \nand I do. \n\n\n\n \n\n207 \n \n\nBut I\u2019m too exhausted to begin any detailed plan tonight. \nMy wounds recovering, my mind still a bit foggy from the ve-\nnom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on \nmy shoulder, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for \nthe first time, how very lonely I\u2019ve been in the arena. How \ncomforting the presence of another human being can be. I give \nin to my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will \nturn. Tomorrow, it\u2019s the Careers who will have to watch their \nbacks. \n\nThe boom of the cannon jolts me awake. The sky\u2019s streaked \nwith light, the birds already chattering. Rue perches in a \nbranch across from me, her hands cupping something. We \nwait, listening for more shots, but there aren\u2019t any. \n\n\u201cWho do you think that was?\u201d I can\u2019t help thinking of Peeta. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It could have been any of the others,\u201d says \n\nRue. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll know tonight.\u201d \n\u201cWho\u2019s left again?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThe boy from District One. Both tributes from Two. The \n\nboy from Three. Thresh and me. And you and Peeta,\u201d says Rue. \n\u201cThat\u2019s eight. Wait, and the boy from Ten, the one with the bad \nleg. He makes nine.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s someone else, but neither of us can remember who \nit is. \n\n\u201cI wonder how that last one died,\u201d says Rue. \n\u201cNo telling. But it\u2019s good for us. A death should hold the \n\ncrowd for a bit. Maybe we\u2019ll have time to do something before \nthe Gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly,\u201d \nI say. \u201cWhat\u2019s in your hands?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n208 \n \n\n\u201cBreakfast,\u201d says Rue. She holds them out revealing two big \neggs. \n\n\u201cWhat kind are those?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNot sure. There\u2019s a marshy area over that way. Some kind \n\nof waterbird,\u201d she says. \nIt\u2019d be nice to cook them, but neither of us wants to risk a \n\nfire. My guess is the tribute who died today was a victim of the \nCareers, which means they\u2019ve recovered enough to be back in \nthe Games. We each suck out the insides of an egg, eat a rabbit \nleg and some berries. It\u2019s a good breakfast anywhere. \n\n\u201cReady to do it?\u201d I say, pulling on my pack. \n\u201cDo what?\u201d says Rue, but by the way she bounces up, you \n\ncan tell she\u2019s up for whatever I propose. \n\u201cToday we take out the Careers\u2019 food,\u201d I say. \n\u201cReally? How?\u201d You can see the glint of excitement in her \n\neyes. In this way, she\u2019s exactly the opposite of Prim for whom \nadventures are an ordeal. \n\n\u201cNo idea. Come on, we\u2019ll figure out a plan while we hunt,\u201d I \nsay. \n\nWe don\u2019t get much hunting done though because I\u2019m too \nbusy getting every scrap of information I can out of Rue about \nthe Careers\u2019 base. She\u2019s only been in to spy on them briefly, \nbut she\u2019s observant. They have set up their camp beside the \nlake. Their supply stash is about thirty yards away. During the \nday, they\u2019ve been leaving another tribute, the boy from Dis-\ntrict 3, to watch over the supplies. \n\n\u201cThe boy from District Three?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe\u2019s working with \nthem?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n209 \n \n\n\u201cYes, he stays at the camp full-time. He got stung, too, when \nthey drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,\u201d says Rue. \u201cI \nguess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But \nhe\u2019s not very big.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat weapons does he have?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNot much that I could see. A spear. He might be able to \n\nhold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill him easily,\u201d \nsays Rue. \n\n\u201cAnd the food\u2019s just out in the open?\u201d I say. She nods. \n\u201cSomething\u2019s not quite right about that whole setup.\u201d \n\n\u201cI know. But I couldn\u2019t tell what exactly,\u201d says Rue. \u201cKatniss, \neven if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it?\u201d \n\n\u201cBurn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel.\u201d I poke Rue in \nthe belly, just like I would Prim. \u201cEat it!\u201d She giggles. \u201cDon\u2019t \nworry, I\u2019ll think of something. Destroying things is much easi-\ner than making them.\u201d \n\nFor a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, we \ndevise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue, \nthe oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who \ngives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the \nmeadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less ob-\nliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves \nmost in the world, replies, of all things, \u201cMusic.\u201d \n\n\u201cMusic?\u201d I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere be-\ntween hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At \nleast a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. \u201cYou have a \nlot of time for that?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n210 \n \n\n\u201cWe sing at home. At work, too. That\u2019s why I love your pin,\u201d \nshe says, pointing to the mockingjay that I\u2019ve again forgotten \nabout. \n\n\u201cYou have mockingjays?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cOh, yes. I have a few that are my special friends. We can \n\nsing back and forth for hours. They carry messages for me,\u201d \nshe says. \n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I say. \n\u201cI\u2019m usually up highest, so I\u2019m the first to see the flag that \n\nsignals quitting time. There\u2019s a special little song I do,\u201d says \nRue. She opens her mouth and sings a little four-note run in a \nsweet, clear voice. \u201cAnd the mockingjays spread it around the \norchard. That\u2019s how everyone knows to knock off,\u201d she con-\ntinues. \u201cThey can be dangerous though, if you get too near \ntheir nests. But you can\u2019t blame them for that.\u201d \n\nI unclasp the pin and hold it out to her. \u201cHere, you take it. It \nhas more meaning for you than me.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d says Rue, closing my fingers back over the pin. \u201cI \nlike to see it on you. That\u2019s how I decided I could trust you. \nBesides, I have this.\u201d She pulls a necklace woven out of some \nkind of grass from her shirt. On it, hangs a roughly carved \nwooden star. Or maybe it\u2019s a flower. \u201cIt\u2019s a good luck charm.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s worked so far,\u201d I say, pinning the mockingjay \nback on my shirt. \u201cMaybe you should just stick with that.\u201d \n\nBy lunch, we have a plan. By early afternoon, we are poised \nto carry it out. I help Rue collect and place the wood for the \nfirst two campfires, the third she\u2019ll have time for on her own. \nWe decide to meet afterward at the site where we ate our first \n\n\n\n \n\n211 \n \n\nmeal together. The stream should help guide me back to it. Be-\nfore I leave, I make sure Rue\u2019s well stocked with food and \nmatches. I even insist she take my sleeping bag, in case it\u2019s not \npossible to rendezvous by nightfall. \n\n\u201cWhat about you? Won\u2019t you be cold?\u201d she asks. \n\u201cNot if I pick up another bag down by the lake,\u201d I say. \u201cYou \n\nknow, stealing isn\u2019t illegal here,\u201d I say with a grin. \nAt the last minute, Rue decides to teach me her mockingjay \n\nsignal, the one she gives to indicate the day\u2019s work is done. \u201cIt \nmight not work. But if you hear the mockingjays singing it, \nyou\u2019ll know I\u2019m okay, only I can\u2019t get back right away.\u201d \n\n\u201cAre there many mockingjays here?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen them? They\u2019ve got nests everywhere,\u201d \n\nshe says. I have to admit I haven\u2019t noticed. \n\u201cOkay, then. If all goes according to plan, I\u2019ll see you for \n\ndinner,\u201d I say. \nUnexpectedly, Rue throws her arms around me. I only hesi-\n\ntate a moment before I hug her back. \n\u201cYou be careful,\u201d she says to me. \n\u201cYou, too,\u201d I say. I turn and head back to the stream, feeling \n\nsomehow worried. About Rue being killed, about Rue not be-\ning killed and the two of us being left for last, about leaving \nRue alone, about leaving Prim alone back home. No, Prim has \nmy mother and Gale and a baker who has promised she won\u2019t \ngo hungry. Rue has only me. \n\nOnce I reach the stream, I have only to follow it downhill to \nthe place I initially picked it up after the tracker jacker attack. \nI have to be cautious as I move along the water though, be-\n\n\n\n \n\n212 \n \n\ncause I find my thoughts preoccupied with unanswered ques-\ntions, most of which concern Peeta. The cannon that fired ear-\nly this morning, did that signify his death? If so, how did he \ndie? At the hand of a Career? And was that in revenge for let-\nting me live? I struggle again to remember that moment over \nGlimmer\u2019s body, when he burst through the trees. But just the \nfact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that \nhappened. \n\nI must have been moving very slowly yesterday because I \nreach the shallow stretch where I took my bath in just a few \nhours. I stop to replenish my water and add a layer of mud to \nmy backpack. It seems bent on reverting to orange no matter \nhow many times I cover it. \n\nMy proximity to the Careers\u2019 camp sharpens my senses, \nand the closer I get to them, the more guarded I am, pausing \nfrequently to listen for unnatural sounds, an arrow already fit-\nted into the string of my bow. I don\u2019t see any other tributes, \nbut I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. Patches \nof the sweet berries. A bush with the leaves that healed my \nstings. Clusters of tracker jacker nests in the vicinity of the \ntree I was trapped in. And here and there, the black-and-white \nflash of a mockingjay wing in the branches high over my head. \n\nWhen I reach the tree with the abandoned nest at the foot, I \npause a moment, to gather my courage. Rue has given specific \ninstructions on how to reach the best spying place near the \nlake from this point. Remember, I tell myself. You\u2019re the hunter \n\nnow, not them. I get a firmer grasp on my bow and go on. I \nmake it to the copse Rue has told me about and again have to \n\n\n\n \n\n213 \n \n\nadmire her cleverness. It\u2019s right at the edge of the wood, but \nthe bushy foliage is so thick down low I can easily observe the \nCareer camp without being spotted. Between us lies the flat \nexpanse where the Games began. \n\nThere are four tributes. The boy from District 1, Cato and \nthe girl from District 2, and a scrawny, ashen-skinned boy \nwho must be from District 3. He made almost no impression \non me at all during our time in the Capitol. I can remember \nalmost nothing about him, not his costume, not his training \nscore, not his interview. Even now, as he sits there fiddling \nwith some kind of plastic box, he\u2019s easily ignored in the pres-\nence of his large and domineering companions. But he must \nbe of some value or they wouldn\u2019t have bothered to let him \nlive. Still, seeing him only adds to my sense of unease over \nwhy the Careers would possibly leave him as a guard, why \nthey have allowed him to live at all. \n\nAll four tributes seem to still be recovering from the track-\ner jacker attack. Even from here, I can see the large swollen \nlumps on their bodies. They must not have had the sense to \nremove the stingers, or if they did, not known about the leaves \nthat healed them. Apparently, whatever medicines they found \nin the Cornucopia have been ineffective. \n\nThe Cornucopia sits in its original position, but its insides \nhave been picked clean. Most of the supplies, held in crates, \nburlap sacks, and plastic bins, are piled neatly in a pyramid in \nwhat seems a questionable distance from the camp. Others \nare sprinkled around the perimeter of the pyramid, almost \nmimicking the layout of supplies around the Cornucopia at the \n\n\n\n \n\n214 \n \n\nonset of the Games. A canopy of netting that, aside from dis-\ncouraging birds, seems to be useless shelters the pyramid it-\nself. \n\nThe whole setup is completely perplexing. The distance, the \nnetting, and the presence of the boy from District 3. One \nthing\u2019s for sure, destroying those supplies is not going to be as \nsimple as it looks. Some other factor is at play here, and I\u2019d \nbetter stay put until I figure out what it is. My guess is the py-\nramid is booby-trapped in some manner. I think of concealed \npits, descending nets, a thread that when broken sends a poi-\nsonous dart into your heart. Really, the possibilities are end-\nless. \n\nWhile I am mulling over my options, I hear Cato shout out. \nHe\u2019s pointing up to the woods, far beyond me, and without \nturning I know that Rue must have set the first campfire. We\u2019d \nmade sure to gather enough green wood to make the smoke \nnoticeable. The Careers begin to arm themselves at once. \n\nAn argument breaks out. It\u2019s loud enough for me to hear \nthat it concerns whether or not the boy from District 3 should \nstay or accompany them. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming. We need him in the woods, and his job\u2019s done \nhere anyway. No one can touch those supplies,\u201d says Cato. \n\n\u201cWhat about Lover Boy?\u201d says the boy from District 1. \n\u201cI keep telling you, forget about him. I know where I cut \n\nhim. It\u2019s a miracle he hasn\u2019t bled to death yet. At any rate, he\u2019s \nin no shape to raid us,\u201d says Cato. \n\nSo Peeta is out there in the woods, wounded badly. But I am \nstill in the dark on what motivated him to betray the Careers. \n\n\n\n \n\n215 \n \n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d says Cato. He thrusts a spear into the hands of \nthe boy from District 3, and they head off in the direction of \nthe fire. The last thing I hear as they enter the woods is Cato \nsaying, \u201cWhen we find her, I kill her in my own way, and no \none interferes.\u201d \n\nSomehow I don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about Rue. She didn\u2019t \ndrop a nest of tracker jackers on him. \n\nI stay put for a half an hour or so, trying to figure out what \nto do about the supplies. The one advantage I have with the \nbow and arrow is distance. I could send a flaming arrow into \nthe pyramid easily enough \u2014 I\u2019m a good enough shot to get it \nthrough those openings in the net \u2014 but there\u2019s no guarantee \nit would catch. More likely it\u2019d just burn itself out and then \nwhat? I\u2019d have achieved nothing and given them far too much \ninformation about myself. That I was here, that I have an ac-\ncomplice, that I can use the bow and arrow with accuracy. \n\nThere\u2019s no alternative. I\u2019m going to have to get in closer and \nsee if I can\u2019t discover what exactly protects the supplies. In \nfact, I\u2019m just about to reveal myself when a movement catches \nmy eye. Several hundred yards to my right, I see someone \nemerge from the woods. For a second, I think it\u2019s Rue, but then \nI recognize Foxface \u2014 she\u2019s the one we couldn\u2019t remember \nthis morning \u2014 creeping out onto the plain. When she decides \nit\u2019s safe, she runs for the pyramid, with quick, small steps. Just \nbefore she reaches the circle of supplies that have been lit-\ntered around the pyramid, she stops, searches the ground, and \ncarefully places her feet on a spot. Then she begins to ap-\nproach the pyramid with strange little hops, sometimes land-\n\n\n\n \n\n216 \n \n\ning on one foot, teetering slightly, sometimes risking a few \nsteps. At one point, she launches up in the air, over a small \nbarrel and lands poised on her tiptoes. But she overshot \nslightly, and her momentum throws her forward. I hear her \ngive a sharp squeal as her hands hit the ground, but nothing \nhappens. In a moment, she\u2019s regained her feet and continues \nuntil she has reached the bulk of the supplies. \n\nSo, I\u2019m right about the booby trap, but it\u2019s clearly more \ncomplex than I had imagined. I was right about the girl, too. \nHow wily is she to have discovered this path into the food and \nto be able to replicate it so neatly? She fills her pack, taking a \nfew items from a variety of containers, crackers from a crate, a \nhandful of apples from a burlap sack that hangs suspended \nfrom a rope off the side of a bin. But only a handful from each, \nnot enough to tip off that the food is missing. Not enough to \ncause suspicion. And then she\u2019s doing her odd little dance \nback out of the circle and scampering into the woods again, \nsafe and sound. \n\nI realize I\u2019m grinding my teeth in frustration. Foxface has \nconfirmed what I\u2019d already guessed. But what sort of trap \nhave they laid that requires such dexterity? Has so many trig-\nger points? Why did she squeal so as her hands made contact \nwith the earth? You\u2019d have thought . . . and slowly it begins to \ndawn on me . . . you\u2019d have thought the very ground was going \nto explode. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mined,\u201d I whisper. That explains everything. The Ca-\nreers\u2019 willingness to leave their supplies, Foxface\u2019s reaction, \nthe involvement of the boy from District 3, where they have \n\n\n\n \n\n217 \n \n\nthe factories, where they make televisions and automobiles \nand explosives. But where did he get them? In the supplies? \nThat\u2019s not the sort of weapon the Gamemakers usually pro-\nvide, given that they like to see the tributes draw blood per-\nsonally. I slip out of the bushes and cross to one of the round \nmetal plates that lifted the tributes into the arena. The ground \naround it has been dug up and patted back down. The land \nmines were disabled after the sixty seconds we stood on the \nplates, but the boy from District 3 must have managed to reac-\ntivate them. I\u2019ve never seen anyone in the Games do that. I bet \nit came as a shock even to the Gamemakers. \n\nWell, hurray for the boy from District 3 for putting one over \non them, but what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, I can\u2019t \ngo strolling into that mess without blowing myself sky-high. \nAs for sending in a burning arrow, that\u2019s more laughable than \never. The mines are set off by pressure. It doesn\u2019t have to be a \nlot, either. One year, a girl dropped her token, a small wooden \nball, while she was at her plate, and they literally had to \nscrape bits of her off the ground. \n\nMy arm\u2019s pretty good, I might be able to chuck some rocks \nin there and set off what? Maybe one mine? That could start a \nchain reaction. Or could it? Would the boy from District 3 have \nplaced the mines in such a way that a single mine would not \ndisturb the others? Thereby protecting the supplies but ensur-\ning the death of the invader. Even if I only blew up one mine, \nI\u2019d draw the Careers back down on me for sure. And anyway, \nwhat am I thinking? There\u2019s that net, clearly strung to deflect \nany such attack. Besides, what I\u2019d really need is to throw \n\n\n\n \n\n218 \n \n\nabout thirty rocks in there at once, setting off a big chain reac-\ntion, demolishing the whole lot. \n\nI glance back up at the woods. The smoke from Rue\u2019s \nsecond fire is wafting toward the sky. By now, the Careers \nhave probably begun to suspect some sort of trick. Time is \nrunning out. \n\nThere is a solution to this, I know there is, if I can only focus \nhard enough. I stare at the pyramid, the bins, the crates, too \nheavy to topple over with an arrow. Maybe one contains cook-\ning oil, and the burning arrow idea is reviving when I realize I \ncould end up losing all twelve of my arrows and not get a di-\nrect hit on an oil bin, since I\u2019d just be guessing. I\u2019m genuinely \nthinking of trying to re-create Foxface\u2019s trip up to the pyramid \nin hopes of finding a new means of destruction when my eyes \nlight on the burlap bag of apples. I could sever the rope in one \nshot, didn\u2019t I do as much in the Training Center? It\u2019s a big bag, \nbut it still might only be good for one explosion. If only I could \nfree the apples themselves . . . \n\nI know what to do. I move into range and give myself three \narrows to get the job done. I place my feet carefully, block out \nthe rest of the world as I take meticulous aim, The first arrow \ntears through the side of the bag near the top, leaving a split in \nthe burlap. The second widens it to a gaping hole. I can see the \nfirst apple teetering when I let the third arrow go, catching the \ntorn flap of burlap and ripping it from the bag. \n\nFor a moment, everything seems frozen in time. Then the \napples spill to the ground and I\u2019m blown backward into the \nair. \n\n\n\n \n\n219 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks \n\nthe wind out of me. My backpack does little to soften the blow. \nFortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, \nsparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in \nmy grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. I can\u2019t hear \nthem. I can\u2019t hear anything at the moment. But the apples \nmust have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the \nothers. I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered \nbits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An \nacrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for \nsomeone trying to regain the ability to breathe. \n\nAfter about a minute, the ground stops vibrating. I roll on \nmy side and allow myself a moment of satisfaction the sight of \nthe smoldering wreckage that was recently the pyramid. The \nCareers aren\u2019t likely to salvage anything out of that. \n\nI\u2019d better get out of here, I think. They\u2019ll be making a beeline \n\nfor the place. But once I\u2019m on my feet, I realize escape may not \nbe so simple. I\u2019m dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the \nkind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the \nearth to move in waves under your feet. \n\nI take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and \nknees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesn\u2019t. \n\n\n\n \n\n220 \n \n\nPanic begins to set in. I can\u2019t stay here. Flight is essential. \nBut I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear, \nthe one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away \nbloody. Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frigh-\ntens me. I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, \nmaybe more at times. But I can\u2019t let my fear show. Absolutely, \npositively, I am live on every screen in Panem. \n\nNo blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up \nover my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative \nfingers. That should help soak up the blood. I can\u2019t walk, but \ncan I crawl? I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slow-\nly, I can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. \nMy only hope is to make it back to Rue\u2019s copse and conceal \nmyself in greenery. I can\u2019t get caught out here on my hands \nand knees in the open. Not only will I face death, it\u2019s sure to be \na long and painful one at Cato\u2019s hand. The thought of Prim \nhaving to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way to-\nward the hideout. \n\nAnother blast knocks me flat on my face. A stray mine, set \noff by some collapsing crate. This happens twice more. I\u2019m \nreminded of those last few kernels that burst when Prim and I \npop corn over the fire at home. \n\nTo say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I \nhave literally just dragged myself into the tangle of hushes at \nthe base of the trees when there\u2019s Cato, barreling onto the \nplain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme \nit might be comical \u2014 so people really do tear out their hair \nand beat the ground with their fists \u2014 if I didn\u2019t know that it \n\n\n\n \n\n221 \n \n\nwas aimed at me, at what I have done to him. Add to that my \nproximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact, \nthe whole thing has me terrified. I\u2019m glad my hiding place \nmakes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me \nbecause I\u2019m biting my nails like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Gnawing \noff the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from \nchattering. \n\nThe boy from District 3 throws stones into the ruins and \nmust have declared all the mines activated because the Ca-\nreers are approaching the wreckage. \n\nCato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes \nout his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various \ncontainers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess, \nlooking for anything to salvage, but there\u2019s nothing. The boy \nfrom District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur \nto Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be \nshouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn \nand run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. I \ncan see the muscles ripple in Cato\u2019s arms as he sharply jerks \nthe boy\u2019s head to the side. \n\nIt\u2019s that quick. The death of the boy from District 3. \nThe other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato \n\ndown. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep \npointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. \n\nThey think whoever set off the explosions is dead. \n\nThey don\u2019t know about the arrows and the apples. They as-\nsume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew \nup the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, \n\n\n\n \n\n222 \n \n\nit could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. \nThe shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. \nThey retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers \nto retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait. \n\nI suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes \nthe dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. Night falls. Up \nin the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have be-\ngun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District \n3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died \nthis morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. \nThe bomber survived. In the seal\u2019s light, I can see Cato and the \ngirl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy \nfrom District 1 ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating \nthe grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride \nback into the woods to hunt. \n\nThe dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still \ndeafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good \nsign. There\u2019s no point in leaving my hiding place, though. I\u2019m \nabout as safe as I can be, here at the crime scene. They proba-\nbly think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. \nStill it\u2019s a long time before I risk moving. \n\nThe first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them \non, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunt-\ner\u2019s senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood \nfrom my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted \npredators \u2014 fresh blood is bad enough \u2014 I make a good meal \nout of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered to-\nday. \n\n\n\n \n\n223 \n \n\nWhere is my little ally? Did she make it back to the \nrendezvous point? Is she worried about me? At least, the sky \nhas shown we\u2019re both alive. \n\nI run through the surviving tributes on my fingers. The boy \nfrom 1, both from 2, Foxface, both from 11 and 12. Just eight \nof us. The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol. \nThey\u2019ll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably \ninterviewing our friends and families. It\u2019s been a long time \nsince a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And \nnow there are two of us. Although from what Cato said, Pee-\nta\u2019s on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything. \nDidn\u2019t he just lose his entire stash of supplies? \n\nLet the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I think. Let \n\nthem begin for real. \n\nA cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping bag \nbefore I remember I left it with Rue. I was supposed to pick up \nanother one, but what with the mines and all, I forgot. I begin \nto shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isn\u2019t sensible an-\nyway, I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself \nwith leaves and pine needles. I\u2019m still freezing. I lay my sheet \nof plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to \nblock the wind. It\u2019s a little better. I begin to have more sympa-\nthy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night. \nBut now it\u2019s me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out \nuntil morning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my arms \ninside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow, \nI drift off to sleep. \n\n\n\n \n\n224 \n \n\nWhen I open my eyes, the world looks slightly fractured, \nand it takes a minute to realize that the sun must be well up \nand the glasses fragmenting my vision. As I sit up and remove \nthem, I hear a laugh somewhere near the lake and freeze. The \nlaugh\u2019s distorted, but the fact that it registered at all means I \nmust be regaining my hearing. Yes, my right ear can hear \nagain, although it\u2019s still ringing. As for my left ear, well, at least \nthe bleeding has stopped. \n\nI peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have re-\nturned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, it\u2019s Fox-\nface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. She\u2019s \nsmarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items \nin the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. I\u2019m perplexed by her \namusement until I realize that with the Careers\u2019 stores elimi-\nnated, she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of \nus. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a \nsecond ally against that pack. But I rule it out. There\u2019s some-\nthing about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending \nFoxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that \nin mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But she\u2019s \nheard something, not me, because her head turns away, to-\nward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No \none, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was danger-\nous, maybe it\u2019s time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, I\u2019m \neager to tell Rue about the pyramid. \n\nSince I\u2019ve no idea where the Careers are, the route back by \nthe stream seems as good as any. I hurry, loaded bow in one \nhand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because I\u2019m fa-\n\n\n\n \n\n225 \n \n\nmished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat \nand protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. \nOnce there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care \nwith my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using the stream as a \nguide. At one point, I find boot prints in the mud along the \nbank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The \nprints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now \nthey\u2019re nearly dry in the hot sun. I haven\u2019t been careful \nenough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the \npine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off my boots \nand socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream. \n\nThe cool water has an invigorating effect on my body, my \nspirits. I shoot two fish, easy pickings in this slow-moving \nstream, and go ahead and eat one raw even though I\u2019ve just \nhad the groosling. The second I\u2019ll save for Rue. \n\nGradually, subtly, the ringing in my right ear diminishes un-\ntil it\u2019s gone entirely. I find myself pawing at my left ear period-\nically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to col-\nlect sounds. If there\u2019s improvement, it\u2019s undetectable. I can\u2019t \nadjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced \nand defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning \nto the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the \nwall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant \nflow of information. The more time that passes, the less hope-\nful I am that this is an injury that will heal. \n\nWhen I reach the site of our first meeting, I feel certain it\u2019s \nbeen undisturbed. There\u2019s no sign of Rue, not on the ground \nor in the trees. This is odd. By now she should have returned, \n\n\n\n \n\n226 \n \n\nas it\u2019s midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree \nsomewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Ca-\nreers with their night-vision glasses tramping around the \nwoods. And the third fire she was supposed to set \u2014 although \nI forgot to check for it last night \u2014 was the farthest from our \nsite of all. She\u2019s probably just being cautious about making her \nway back. I wish she\u2019d hurry, because I don\u2019t want to hang \naround here too long. I want to spend the afternoon traveling \nto higher ground, hunting as we go. But there\u2019s nothing really \nfor me to do but wait. \n\nI wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ev-\ner-growing list of wounds. The burns are much better but I \nuse a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to wor-\nry about now is keeping out infection. I go ahead and eat the \nsecond fish. It isn\u2019t going to last long in this hot sun, but it \nshould be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she \nwould just show up. \n\nFeeling too vulnerable on the ground with my lopsided \nhearing, I scale a tree to wait. If the Careers show up, this will \nbe a fine place to shoot them from. The sun moves slowly. I do \nthings to pass the time. Chew leaves and apply them to my \nstings that are deflated but still tender. Comb through my \ndamp hair with my fingers and braid it. Lace my boots back \nup. Check over my bow and remaining nine arrows. Test my \nleft ear repeatedly for signs of life by rustling a leaf near it, but \nwithout good results. \n\nDespite the groosling and the fish, my stomach\u2019s growling, \nand I know I\u2019m going to have what we call a hollow day back \n\n\n\n \n\n227 \n \n\nin District 12. That\u2019s a day where no matter what you put in \nyour belly, it\u2019s never enough. Having nothing to do but sit in a \ntree makes it worse, so I decide to give into it. After all, I\u2019ve \nlost a lot of weight in the arena, I need some extra calories. \nAnd having the bow and arrows makes me far more confident \nabout my future prospects. \n\nI slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The \ngroosling neck. That\u2019s good because it takes time to pick clean. \nFinally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But it\u2019s a hol-\nlow day, and even with all that I start daydreaming about \nfood. Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. \nThe chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding. \nBread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried \nplum stew. I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get \nover it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper \noften, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. \nSort of. \n\nDangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouth-\nful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand . . . this is the most re-\nlaxed I\u2019ve been since I\u2019ve entered the arena. If only Rue would \nshow up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so \ndoes my restlessness. By late afternoon, I\u2019ve resolved to go \nlooking for her. I can at least visit the spot where she set the \nthird fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts. \n\nBefore I go, I scatter a few mint leaves around our old \ncampfire. Since we gathered these some distance away, Rue \nwill understand I\u2019ve been here, while they\u2019ll mean nothing to \nthe Careers. \n\n\n\n \n\n228 \n \n\nIn less than an hour, I\u2019m at the place where we agreed to \nhave the third fire and I know something has gone amiss. The \nwood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with \ntinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up the fire but never \nmade it back here. Somewhere between the second column of \nsmoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she \nran into trouble. \n\nI have to remind myself she\u2019s still alive. Or is she? Could the \ncannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee \nhours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken \nto pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to \nbelieve it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She \ncould have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or \nanother tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever hap-\npened, I\u2019m almost certain she\u2019s stuck out there, somewhere \nbetween the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Some-\nthing is keeping her up a tree. \n\nI think I\u2019ll go hunt it down. \nIt\u2019s a relief to be doing something after sitting around all af-\n\nternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, letting them \nconceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. There\u2019s no sign of \nany kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the \nground. I\u2019ve stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have \nto cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is \nagain. Rue\u2019s four-note tune coming out of a mockingjay\u2019s \nmouth. The one that means she\u2019s all right. \n\nI grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a \nshort distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue \n\n\n\n \n\n229 \n \n\nhas been singing to them, and recently. Otherwise they\u2019d have \ntaken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, \nsearching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hop-\ning she\u2019ll know it\u2019s safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the \nmelody to me. And that\u2019s when I hear the scream. \n\nIt\u2019s a child\u2019s scream, a young girl\u2019s scream, there\u2019s no one in \nthe arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now \nI\u2019m running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three \nCareers may be poised to attack me, but I can\u2019t help myself. \nThere\u2019s another high-pitched cry, this time my name. \u201cKatniss! \nKatniss!\u201d \n\n\u201cRue!\u201d I shout back, so she knows I\u2019m near. So, they know \nI\u2019m near, and hopefully the girl who has attacked them with \ntracker jackers and gotten an eleven they still can\u2019t explain \nwill be enough to pull their attention away from her. \u201cRue! I\u2019m \ncoming!\u201d \n\nWhen I break into the clearing, she\u2019s on the ground, hope-\nlessly entangled in a net. She just has time to reach her hand \nthrough the mesh and say my name before the spear enters \nher body. \n\n\n\n \n\n230 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the \n\nspear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He \nfalls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by \nyanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I\u2019m re-\nloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, \n\u201cAre there more? Are there more?\u201d \n\nShe has to say no several times before I hear it. Rue has \nrolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I \nshove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing \nher from the net. One look at the wound and I know it\u2019s far \nbeyond my capacity to heal, beyond anyone\u2019s probably. The \nspearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch \nbefore her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. \nThere\u2019s no point in comforting words, in telling her she\u2019ll be \nall right. She\u2019s no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like \na lifeline. As if it\u2019s me who\u2019s dying instead of Rue. \n\n\u201cYou blew up the food?\u201d she whispers. \n\u201cEvery last bit,\u201d I say. \n\u201cYou have to win,\u201d she says. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to. Going to win for both of us now,\u201d I promise. I \n\nhear a cannon and look up. It must be for the boy from District \n1. \n\n\n\n \n\n231 \n \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d Rue tightens her grip on my hand. \n\u201cCourse not. Staying right here,\u201d I say. I move in closer to \n\nher, pulling her head onto my lap. I gently brush the dark, \nthick hair back behind her ear. \n\n\u201cSing,\u201d she says, but I barely catch the word. \nSing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or \n\nnot, there was once music in my house, too. Music I helped \nmake. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice \u2014 \nbut I haven\u2019t sung much since he died. Except when Prim is \nvery sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby. \n\nSing. My throat is tight with tears, hoarse from smoke and \nfatigue. But if this is Prim\u2019s, I mean, Rue\u2019s last request, I have \nto at least try. The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, \none we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with, It\u2019s old, very \nold I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music \nteacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and \nsoothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this \nawful piece of time we call today. \n\nI give a small cough, swallow hard, and begin: \n \nDeep in the meadow, under the willow \n\nA bed of grass, a soft green pillow \n\nLay down your head, and close your sleepy eyes \n\nAnd when again they open, the sun will rise. \n\n \n\nHere it\u2019s safe, here it\u2019s warm \n\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \n\n\n\n \n\n232 \n \n\nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them \n\ntrue \n\nHere is the place where I love you. \n\n \nRue\u2019s eyes have fluttered shut. Her chest moves but only \n\nslightly. My throat releases the tears and they slide down my \ncheeks. But I have to finish the song for her. \n\n \nDeep in the meadow, hidden far away \n\nA cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray \n\nForget your woes and let your troubles lay \n\nAnd when again it\u2019s morning, they\u2019ll wash away. \n\n \nHere it\u2019s safe, here it\u2019s warm \n\nHere the daisies guard you from every harm \n\n \nThe final lines are barely audible. \n\n \nHere your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them \n\ntrue \n\nHere is the place where I love you. \n\n \nEverything\u2019s still and quiet. Then, almost eerily, the mock-\n\ningjays take up my song. \nFor a moment, I sit there, watching my tears drip down on \n\nher face. Rue\u2019s cannon fires. I lean forward and press my lips \nagainst her temple. Slowly, as if not to wake her, I lay her head \nback on the ground and release her hand. \n\n\n\n \n\n233 \n \n\nThey\u2019ll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the \nbodies. And there\u2019s nothing to stay for. I roll the boy from Dis-\ntrict 1 onto his face and take his pack, retrieve the arrow that \nended his life. I cut Rue\u2019s pack from her back as well, knowing \nshe\u2019d want me to have it but leave the spear in her stomach. \nWeapons in bodies will be transported to the hovercraft. I\u2019ve \nno use for a spear, so the sooner it\u2019s gone from the arena the \nbetter. \n\nI can\u2019t stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal \ncurled up in a nest of netting. I can\u2019t bring myself to leave her \nlike this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate \nthe boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in \ndeath, seems inadequate. It\u2019s the Capitol I hate, for doing this \nto all of us. \n\nGale\u2019s voice is in my head. His ravings against the Capitol \nno longer pointless, no longer to be ignored. Rue\u2019s death has \nforced me to confront my own fury against the cruelty, the in-\njustice they inflict upon us. But here, even more strongly than \nat home, I feel my impotence. There\u2019s no way to take revenge \non the Capitol. Is there? \n\nThen I remember Peeta\u2019s words on the roof. \u201cOnly I keep \n\nwishing I could think of a way to . . . to show the Capital they \n\ndon\u2019t own me. That I\u2019m more than just a piece in their Games.\u201d \n\nAnd for the first time, I understand what he means. \nI want to do something, right here, right now, to shame \n\nthem, to make them accountable, to show the Capitol that \nwhatever they do or force us to do there is a part of every tri-\n\n\n\n \n\n234 \n \n\nbute they can\u2019t own. That Rue was more than a piece in their \nGames. And so am I. \n\nA few steps into the woods grows a bank of wildflowers. \nPerhaps they are really weeds of some sort, but they have \nblossoms in beautiful shades of violet and yellow and white. I \ngather up an armful and come back to Rue\u2019s side. Slowly, one \nstem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering \nthe ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with \nbright colors. \n\nThey\u2019ll have to show it. Or, even if they choose to turn the \ncameras elsewhere at this moment, they\u2019ll have to bring them \nback when they collect the bodies and everyone will see her \nthen and know I did it. I step back and take a last look at Rue. \nShe could really be asleep in that meadow after all. \n\n\u201cBye, Rue,\u201d I whisper. I press the three middle fingers of my \nleft hand against my lips and hold them out in her direction. \nThen I walk away without looking back. \n\nThe birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the \nwarning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don\u2019t know \nhow it knows. It must hear things that humans can\u2019t. I pause, \nmy eyes focused on what\u2019s ahead, not what\u2019s happening be-\nhind me. It doesn\u2019t take long, then the general birdsong begins \nagain and I know she\u2019s gone. \n\nAnother mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on \na branch before me and bursts out Rue\u2019s melody. \n\nMy song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice \nto pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones \nthat mean she\u2019s safe. \n\n\n\n \n\n235 \n \n\n\u201cGood and safe,\u201d I say as I pass under its branch. \u201cWe don\u2019t \nhave to worry about her now.\u201d Good and safe. \n\nI\u2019ve no idea where to go. The brief sense of home I had that \none night with Rue has vanished. My feet wander this way and \nthat until sunset. I\u2019m not afraid, not even watchful. Which \nmakes me an easy target. Except I\u2019d kill anyone I met on sight. \nWithout emotion or the slightest tremor in my hands. My ha-\ntred of the Capitol has not lessened my hatred of my competi-\ntors in the least. Especially the Careers. They, at least, can be \nmade to pay for Rue\u2019s death. \n\nNo one materializes though. There aren\u2019t many of us left \nand it\u2019s a big arena. Soon they\u2019ll be pulling out some other de-\nvice to force us together. But there\u2019s been enough gore today. \nPerhaps we\u2019ll even get to sleep. \n\nI\u2019m about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when \na silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift \nfrom a sponsor. But why now? I\u2019ve been in fairly good shape \nwith supplies. Maybe Haymitch\u2019s noticed my despondency \nand is trying to cheer me up a bit. Or could it be something to \nhelp my ear? \n\nI open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread It\u2019s not \nthe fine white Capitol stuff. It\u2019s made of dark ration grain and \nshaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flash back to Pee-\nta\u2019s lesson on the various district breads in the Training Cen-\nter. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still \nwarm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 \nwho can\u2019t even feed themselves? How many would\u2019ve had to \ndo without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this \n\n\n\n \n\n236 \n \n\none loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of \npulling the gift when she died, they\u2019d authorized Haymitch to \ngive it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don\u2019t \nlike to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. \nA district gift to a tribute who\u2019s not your own. \n\nI lift my face and step into the last falling rays of sunlight. \n\u201cMy thanks to the people of District Eleven,\u201d I say. I want them \nto know I know where it came from. That the full value of \ntheir gift has been recognized. \n\nI climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to \nget as far away from today as I can. My sleeping bag is rolled \nneatly in Rue\u2019s pack. Tomorrow I\u2019ll sort through the supplies. \nTomorrow I\u2019ll make a new plan. But tonight, all I can do is \nstrap myself in and take tiny bites of the bread. It\u2019s good. It \ntastes of home. \n\nSoon the seal\u2019s in the sky, the anthem plays in my right ear. \nI see the boy from District 1, Rue. That\u2019s all for tonight. Six of \n\nus left, I think. Only six. With the bread still locked in my \nhands, I fall asleep at once. \n\nSometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will \ngive me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. \nAn hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me \nRue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, \ntrying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of \nher wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings \nsongs I\u2019ve never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. \nThrough the night. There\u2019s a drowsy in-between period when \nI can hear the last few strains of her music although she\u2019s lost \n\n\n\n \n\n237 \n \n\nin the leaves. When I fully awaken, I\u2019m momentarily com-\nforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but \nit quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ev-\ner. \n\nHeaviness infuses my whole body, as if there\u2019s liquid lead in \nmy veins. I\u2019ve lost the will to do the simplest tasks, to do any-\nthing but lie here, staring unblinkingly through the canopy of \nleaves. For several hours, I remain motionless. As usual, it\u2019s \nthe thought of Prim\u2019s anxious face as she watches me on the \nscreens back home that breaks me from my lethargy. \n\nI give myself a series of simple commands to follow, like \n\u201cNow you have to sit up, Katniss. Now you have to drink wa-\nter, Katniss.\u201d I act on the orders with slow, robotic motions. \n\u201cNow you have to sort the packs, Katniss.\u201d \n\nRue\u2019s pack holds my sleeping bag, her nearly empty water \nskin, a handful of nuts and roots, a bit of rabbit, her extra \nsocks, and her slingshot. The boy from District 1 has several \nknives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather \npouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried \nfruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen \nfrom. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother \nto carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? \nWhen you will kill your enemies so quickly you\u2019ll be home be-\nfore you\u2019re hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled \nso lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with \nnothing. \n\nSpeaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish \noff the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How \n\n\n\n \n\n238 \n \n\nquickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue\u2019s roots and \nnuts, the boy\u2019s dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have \n\nto hunt, Katniss, I tell myself. \nI obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack. \n\nAfter I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy\u2019s knives and \nspearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. \nI\u2019ve lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did \nyesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general di-\nrection of the stream. I know I\u2019m on course when I come \nacross Rue\u2019s third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a \nflock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three be-\nfore they know what hit them. I return to Rue\u2019s signal fire and \nstart it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are \n\nyou, Cato? I think as I roast the birds and Rue\u2019s roots. I\u2019m wait-\n\ning right here. \n\nWho knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to \nreach me or too sure this is a trick or ... is it possible? Too \nscared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of \ncourse, Cato saw me take them from Glimmer\u2019s body, but have \nthey put two and two together yet? Figured out I blew up the \nsupplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think \nThresh did this. Wouldn\u2019t he be more likely to revenge Rue\u2019s \ndeath than I would? Being from the same district? Not that he \never took any interest in her. \n\nAnd what about Foxface? Did she hang around to watch me \nblow up the supplies? No. When I caught her laughing in the \nashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a \nlovely surprise. \n\n\n\n \n\n239 \n \n\nI doubt they think Peeta has lit this signal fire. Cato\u2019s sure \nhe\u2019s as good as dead. I find myself wishing I could tell Peeta \nabout the flowers I put on Rue. That I now understand what \nhe was trying to say on the roof. Perhaps if he wins the Games, \nhe\u2019ll see me on victor\u2019s night, when they replay the highlights \nof the Games on a screen over the stage where we did our in-\nterviews. The winner sits in a place of honor on the platform, \nsurrounded by their support crew. \n\nBut I told Rue I\u2019d be there. For both of us. And somehow \nthat seems even more important than the vow I gave Prim. \n\nI really think I stand a chance of doing it now. Winning. It\u2019s \nnot just having the arrows or outsmarting the Careers a few \ntimes, although those things help. Something happened when \nI was holding Rue\u2019s hand, watching the life drain out of her. \nNow I am determined to revenge her, to make her loss unfor-\ngettable, and I can only do that by winning and thereby mak-\ning myself unforgettable. \n\nI overcook the birds hoping someone will show up to shoot, \nbut no one does. Maybe the other tributes are out there beat-\ning one another senseless. Which would be fine, Ever since the \nbloodbath, I\u2019ve been featured on screens most than I care. \n\nEventually, I wrap up my food and go back to the stream to \nreplenish my water and gather some. But the heaviness from \nthe morning drapes back over me and even though it\u2019s only \nearly evening, I climb a tree and settle in for the night. My \nbrain begins to replay the events from yesterday. I keep see-\ning Rue speared, my arrow piercing the boy\u2019s neck. I don\u2019t \nknow why I should even care about the boy. \n\n\n\n \n\n240 \n \n\nThen I realize . . . he was my first kill. \nAlong with other statistics they report to help people place \n\ntheir bets, every tribute has a list of kills. I guess technically \nI\u2019d get credited for Glimmer and the girl from District 4, too, \nfor dumping that nest on them. But the boy from District 1 \nwas the first person I knew would die because of my actions. \nNumerous animals have lost their lives at my hands, but only \none human. I hear Gale saying, \u201cHow different can it be, real-\nly?\u201d \n\nAmazingly similar in the execution. A bow pulled, an arrow \nshot. Entirely different in the aftermath. I killed a boy whose \nname I don\u2019t even know. Somewhere his family is weeping for \nhim. His friends call for my blood. Maybe he had a girlfriend \nwho really believed he would come back . . . \n\nBut then I think of Rue\u2019s still body and I\u2019m able to banish \nthe boy from my mind. At least, for now. \n\nIt\u2019s been an uneventful day according to the sky. No deaths. \nI wonder how long we\u2019ll get until the next catastrophe drives \nus back together. If it\u2019s going to be tonight, I want to get some \nsleep first. I cover my good ear to block out the strains of the \nanthem, but then I hear the trumpets and sit straight up in an-\nticipation. \n\nFor the most part, the only communication the tributes get \nfrom outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasio-\nnally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. \nUsually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the \nGamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere \nknown to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather \n\n\n\n \n\n241 \n \n\nand fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there\u2019s \nnothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete \nfor. I wouldn\u2019t go in for the food, but this could be an ideal \ntime to take out a few competitors. \n\nClaudius Templesmith\u2019s voice booms down from overhead, \ncongratulating the six of us who remain. But he is not inviting \nus to a feast. He\u2019s saying something very confusing. There\u2019s \nbeen a rule change in the Games. A rule change! That in itself \nis mind bending since we don\u2019t really have any rules to speak \nof except don\u2019t step off your circle for sixty seconds and the \nunspoken rule about not eating one another. Under the new \nrule, both tributes from the same district will be declared \nwinners if they are the last two alive. Claudius pauses, as if he \nknows we\u2019re not getting it, and repeats the change again. \n\nThe news sinks in. Two tributes can win this year. If they\u2019re \nfrom the same district. Both can live. Both of us can live. \n\nBefore I can stop myself, I call out Peeta\u2019s name. \n\n\n\n \n\n242 \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPART III \n\"THE VICTOR\" \n\n\n\n \n\n243 \n \n\n \n \n \nI clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already \n\nescaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin \nto sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, \nfrozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I re-\nmember there\u2019s almost no one left. \n\nPeeta, who\u2019s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever \ndoubts I\u2019ve had about him dissipate because if either of us \ntook the other\u2019s life now we\u2019d be pariahs when we returned to \nDistrict 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I\u2019d loathe any tri-\nbute who didn\u2019t immediately ally with their district partner. \nBesides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my \ncase \u2014 being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 \n\u2014 it\u2019s an absolute requirement if I want any more help from \nsympathetic sponsors. \n\nThe star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing \nthat angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have \nmade this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tri-\nbutes to have a shot at winning, our \u201cromance\u201d must be so \npopular with the audience that condemning it would jeopard-\nize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I\u2019ve done is \nmanaged not to kill Peeta. But whatever he\u2019s done in the are-\nna, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me \n\n\n\n \n\n244 \n \n\nalive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornu-\ncopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with \nthe Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it \nturns out, has never been a danger to me. \n\nThe thought makes me smile. I drop my hands and hold my \nface up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. \n\nSo, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tri-\nbute from her district is dead. She\u2019s operating alone, at night. \nAnd her strategy has been to evade, not attack. I don\u2019t really \nthink that, even if she heard my voice, she\u2019d do anything but \nhope someone else would kill me. \n\nThen there\u2019s Thresh. All right, he\u2019s a distinct threat. But I \nhaven\u2019t seen him, not once, since the Games began. I think \nabout how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at \nthe site of the explosion. But she didn\u2019t turn to the Woods, she \nturned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the are-\nna that drops off into I don\u2019t know what. I feel almost certain \nthat the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his do-\nmain. He\u2019d never have heard me from there and, even if he \ndid, I\u2019m up too high for someone his size to reach. \n\nSo that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are \nnow surely celebrating the new rule. They\u2019re the only ones left \nwho benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from \nthem now, on the chance they heard me call Peeta\u2019s name? No, \n\nI think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision \nglasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. \n\nRight into the range of my arrows. But I know they won\u2019t. If \nthey didn\u2019t come in daylight to my fire, they won\u2019t risk what \n\n\n\n \n\n245 \n \n\ncould be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on \ntheir own terms, not because I\u2019ve let them know my wherea-\nbouts. \n\nStay put and get some sleep, Katniss, I instruct myself, al-\nthough I wish I could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow, \n\nyou\u2019ll find him. \n\nI do sleep, but in the morning I\u2019m extra-cautious, thinking \nthat while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree, \nthey\u2019re completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I \nmake sure to fully prepare myself for the day \u2014 eating a big \nbreakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons \u2014 before I \ndescend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the \nground. \n\nToday I\u2019ll have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers will \nknow I\u2019m trying to locate Peeta. They may well want to wait \nuntil I do before they move in. If he\u2019s as badly wounded as Ca-\nto thinks, I\u2019d be in the position of having to defend us both \nwithout any assistance. But if he\u2019s that incapacitated, how has \nhe managed to stay alive? And how on earth will I find him? \n\nI try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me \nan indication as to where he\u2019s hiding out, but nothing rings a \nbell. So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the \nsunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his sword \ndrawn. And after I was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did \nPeeta get away? Maybe he\u2019d held out better against the track-\ner jacker poison than Cato. \n\nMaybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. \nBut he\u2019d been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten, \n\n\n\n \n\n246 \n \n\nstabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive \nall these days since? If the wound and the stingers haven\u2019t \nkilled him, surely thirst would have taken him by now. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He \ncouldn\u2019t have survived without water. I know that from my \nfirst few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a \nsource. There\u2019s the lake, but I find that an unlikely option \nsince it\u2019s so close to the Careers\u2019 base camp. A few spring-fed \npools. But you\u2019d really be a sitting duck at one of those. And \nthe stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made \nall the way down near the lake and beyond. If he stuck to the \nstream, he could change his location and always be near wa-\nter. He could walk in the current and erase any tracks. He \nmight even be able to get a fish or two. \n\nWell, it\u2019s a place to start, anyway. \nTo confuse my enemies\u2019 minds, I start a fire with plenty of \n\ngreen wood. Even if they think it\u2019s a ruse, I hope they\u2019ll decide \nI\u2019m hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, I\u2019ll be tracking \nPeeta. \n\nThe sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately \nand I can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The waters \ncool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. I\u2019m \ntempted to call out Peeta\u2019s name as I go but decide against it. I \nwill have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will \nhave to find me. But he\u2019ll know I\u2019ll be looking, right? He won\u2019t \nhave so low of an opinion of me as to think I\u2019d ignore the new \nrule and keep to myself. Would he? He\u2019s very hard to predict, \n\n\n\n \n\n247 \n \n\nwhich might be interesting under different circumstances, but \nat the moment only provides an extra obstacle. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to \ngo the Careers\u2019 camp. There\u2019s been no sign of Peeta, but this \ndoesn\u2019t surprise me. I\u2019ve been up and down this stretch three \ntimes since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby, \nsurely I\u2019d have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to \ncurve to the left into a part of the woods that\u2019s new to me. \nMuddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large \nrocks that increase in size until I begin to feel somewhat \ntrapped. It would be no small matter to escape the stream \nnow. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky \nterrain. In fact, I\u2019ve just about decided I\u2019m on the wrong track \nentirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate get-\nting to and from this water source, when I see the bloody \nstreak going down the curve of a boulder. It\u2019s long dried now, \nbut the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone \u2014 \nwho perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties \u2014 \ntried to wipe it away. \n\nHugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the \nblood, searching for him. I find a few more bloodstains, one \nwith a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. I \nbreak down and say his name in a hushed voice. \u201cPeeta! Pee-\nta!\u201d Then a mockingjay lands on a scruffy tree and begins to \nmimic my tones so I stop. I give up and climb back down to the \nstream thinking, He must have moved on. Somewhere farther \n\ndown. \n\n\n\n \n\n248 \n \n\nMy foot has just broken the surface of the water when I \nhear a voice. \n\n\u201cYou here to finish me off, sweetheart?\u201d \nI whip around. It\u2019s come from the left, so I can\u2019t pick it up \n\nvery well. And the voice was hoarse and weak. Still, it must \nhave been Peeta. Who else in the arena would call me swee-\ntheart? My eyes peruse the bank, but there\u2019s nothing. Just \nmud, the plants, the base of the rocks. \n\n\u201cPeeta?\u201d I whisper. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d There\u2019s no answer. \nCould I just have imagined it? No, I\u2019m certain it was real and \nvery close at hand, too. \u201cPeeta?\u201d I creep along the bank. \n\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t step on me.\u201d \nI jump back. His voice was right under my feet. Still there\u2019s \n\nnothing. Then his eyes open, unmistakably blue in the brown \nmud and green leaves. I gasp and am rewarded with a hint of \nwhite teeth as he laughs. \n\nIt\u2019s the final word in camouflage. Forget chucking weights \naround. Peeta should have gone into his private session with \nthe Gamemakers and painted himself into a tree. Or a boulder. \nOr a muddy bank full of weeds. \n\n\u201cClose your eyes again,\u201d I order. He does, and his mouth, \ntoo, and completely disappears. Most of what I judge to be his \nbody is actually under a layer of mud and plants. His face and \narms are so artfully disguised as to be invisible. I kneel beside \nhim. \u201cI guess all those hours decorating cakes paid off.\u201d \n\nPeeta smiles. \u201cYes, frosting. The final defense of the dying.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n249 \n \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die,\u201d I tell him firmly. \u201cSays who?\u201d His \nvoice is so ragged. \u201cSays me. We\u2019re on the same team now, you \nknow,\u201d I tell him. \n\nHis eyes open. \u201cSo, I heard. Nice of you to find what\u2019s left of \nme.\u201d \n\nI pull out my water bottle and give him a drink. \u201cDid Cato \ncut you?\u201d I ask. \n\n\u201cLeft leg. Up high,\u201d he answers. \n\u201cLet\u2019s get you in the stream, wash you off so I can see what \n\nkind of wounds you\u2019ve got,\u201d I say. \n\u201cLean down a minute first,\u201d he says. \u201cNeed to tell you some-\n\nthing.\u201d I lean over and put my good ear to his lips, which tickle \nas he whispers. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re madly in love, so it\u2019s all \nright to kiss me anytime you feel like it.\u201d \n\nI jerk my head back but end up laughing. \u201cThanks, I\u2019ll keep \nit in mind.\u201d At least, he\u2019s still able to joke around. But when I \nstart to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. It\u2019s \nonly two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when I real-\nize he\u2019s unable to move an inch on his own. He\u2019s so weak that \nthe best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite \nthe fact that I know he\u2019s doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp \ncries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have \nimprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to \nbreak him from their clutches. He\u2019s still two feet from the wa-\nter, lying there, teeth gritted, tears cutting trails in the dirt on \nhis face. \n\n\u201cLook, Peeta, I\u2019m going to roll you into the stream. It\u2019s very \nshallow here, okay?\u201d I say. \n\n\n\n \n\n250 \n \n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d he says. \nI crouch down beside him. No matter what happens, I tell \n\nmyself, don\u2019t stop until he\u2019s in the water. \u201cOn three,\u201d I say. \n\u201cOne, two, three!\u201d I can only manage one full roll before I have \nto stop because of the horrible sound he\u2019s making. Now he\u2019s \non the edge of the stream. Maybe this is better anyway. \n\n\u201cOkay, change of plans. I\u2019m not going to put you all the way \nin,\u201d I tell him. Besides, if I get him in, who knows if I\u2019d ever be \nable to get him out? \n\n\u201cNo more rolling?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cThat\u2019s all done. Let\u2019s get you cleaned up. Keep an eye on \n\nthe woods for me, okay?\u201d I say. It\u2019s hard to know where to \nstart. He so caked with mud and matted leaves, I can\u2019t even \nsee his clothes. If he\u2019s wearing clothes. The thought makes me \nhesitate a moment, but then I plunge in. Naked bodies are no \nbig deal in the arena, right? \n\nI\u2019ve got two water bottles and Rue\u2019s water skin. I prop them \nagainst rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while \nI pour the third over Peeta\u2019s body. It takes a while, but I finally \nget rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his \njacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His under-\nshirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with \nmy knife and drench him again to work it loose. He\u2019s badly \nbruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker \njacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But I feel a bit \nbetter. This much I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper \nbody first, to alleviate some pain, before I tackle whatever \ndamage Cato did to his leg. \n\n\n\n \n\n251 \n \n\nSince treating his wounds seems pointless when he\u2019s lying \nin what\u2019s become a mud puddle, I manage to prop him up \nagainst a boulder. He sits there, uncomplaining, while I wash \naway all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is \nvery pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and \nstocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker \nlumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute I apply the \nleaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his \nfilthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then I \napply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how \nhot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of \nwater have disguised the fact that he\u2019s burning with fever. I \ndig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 \nand find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother ac-\ntually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her \nhome remedies fail. \n\n\u201cSwallow these,\u201d I tell him, and he obediently takes the \nmedicine. \u201cYou must be hungry.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot really. It\u2019s funny, I haven\u2019t been hungry for days,\u201d says \nPeeta. In fact, when I offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose \nat it and turns away. That\u2019s when I know how sick he is. \n\n\u201cPeeta, we need to get some food in you,\u201d I insist. \n\u201cIt\u2019ll just come right back up,\u201d he says. The best I can do is \n\nto get him to eat a few bits of dried apple. \u201cThanks. I\u2019m much \nbetter, really. Can I sleep now, Katniss?\u201d he asks. \n\n\u201cSoon,\u201d I promise. \u201cI need to look at your leg first.\u201d Trying to \nbe as gentle as I can, I remove his boots, his socks, and then \nvery slowly inch his pants off of him. I can see the tear Cato\u2019s \n\n\n\n \n\n252 \n \n\nsword made in the fabric over his thigh, but it in no way pre-\npares me for what lies underneath. The deep inflamed gash \noozing both blood and pus. The swelling of the leg. And worst \nof all, the smell of festering flesh. \n\nI want to run away. Disappear into the woods like I did that \nday they brought the burn victim to our house. Go and hunt \nwhile my mother and Prim attend to what I have neither the \nskill nor the courage to face. But there\u2019s no one here but me. I \ntry to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when \nhandling particularly bad cases. \n\n\u201cPretty awful, huh?\u201d says Peeta. He\u2019s watching me closely. \n\u201cSo-so.\u201d I shrug like it\u2019s no big deal. \u201cYou should see some of \n\nthe people they bring my mother from the mines.\u201d I refrain \nfrom saying how I usually clear out of the house whenever \nshe\u2019s treating anything worse than a cold. Come to think of it, I \ndon\u2019t even much like to be around coughing. \u201cFirst thing is to \nclean it well.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve left on Peeta\u2019s undershorts because they\u2019re not in bad \nshape and I don\u2019t want to pull them over the swollen thigh \nand, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me \nuncomfortable. That\u2019s another thing about my mother and \nPrim. Nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause \nfor embarrassment. Ironically, at this point in the Games, my \nlittle sister would be of far more use to Peeta than I am. I scoot \nmy square of plastic under him so I can wash down the rest of \nhim. With each bottle I pour over him, the worse the wound \nlooks. The rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just \none tracker jacker sting and a few small burns that I treat \n\n\n\n \n\n253 \n \n\nquickly. But the gash on his leg . . . what on earth can I do for \nthat? \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we give it some air and then . . .\u201d I trail off. \n\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll patch it up?\u201d says Peeta. He looks almost \n\nsorry for me, as if he knows how lost I am. \n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I say. \u201cIn the meantime, you eat these.\u201d I put \n\na few dried pear halves in his hand and go back in the stream \nto wash the rest of his clothes. When they\u2019re flattened out and \ndrying, I examine the contents of the first-aid kit. It\u2019s pretty \nbasic stuff. Bandages, fever pills, medicine to calm stomachs. \nNothing of the caliber I\u2019ll need to treat Peeta. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to experiment some,\u201d I admit. I know \nthe tracker jacker leaves draw out infection, so I start with \nthose. Within minutes of pressing the handful of chewed-up \ngreen stuff into the wound, pus begins running down the side \nof his leg. I tell myself this is a good thing and bite the inside of \nmy cheek hard because my breakfast is threatening to make a \nreappearance. \n\n\u201cKatniss?\u201d Peeta says. I meet his eyes, knowing my face \nmust be some shade of green. He mouths the words. \u201cHow \nabout that kiss?\u201d \n\nI burst out laughing because the whole thing is so revolting \nI can\u2019t stand it. \n\n\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d he asks a little too innocently. \n\u201cI . . . I\u2019m no good at this. I\u2019m not my mother. I\u2019ve no idea \n\nwhat I\u2019m doing and I hate pus,\u201d I say. \u201cEuh!\u201d I allow myself to \nlet out a groan as I rinse away the first round of leaves and \napply the second. \u201cEuuuh!\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n254 \n \n\n\u201cHow do you hunt?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cTrust me. Killing things is much easier than this,\u201d I say. \u201cAl-\n\nthough for all I know, I am killing you.\u201d \n\u201cCan you speed it up a little?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cNo. Shut up and eat your pears,\u201d I say. \nAfter three applications and what seems like a bucket of \n\npus, the wound does look better. Now that the swelling has \ngone down, I can see how deep Cato\u2019s sword cut. Right down \nto the bone. \n\n\u201cWhat next, Dr. Everdeen?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll put some of the burn ointment on it. I think it \n\nhelps with infection anyway. And wrap it up?\u201d I say. I do and \nthe whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in \nclean white cotton. Although, against the sterile bandage, the \nhem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with conta-\ngion. I pull out Rue\u2019s backpack. \u201cHere, cover yourself with this \nand I\u2019ll wash your shorts.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t care if you see me,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cYou\u2019re just like the rest of my family,\u201d I say. \u201cI care, all \n\nright?\u201d I turn my back and look at the stream until the under-\nshorts splash into the current. He must be feeling a bit better \nif he can throw. \n\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re kind of squeamish for such a lethal per-\nson,\u201d says Peeta as I beat the shorts clean between two rocks. \n\u201cI wish I\u2019d let you give Haymitch a shower after all.\u201d \n\nI wrinkle my nose at the memory. \u201cWhat\u2019s he sent you so \nfar?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n255 \n \n\n\u201cNot a thing,\u201d says Peeta. Then there\u2019s a pause as it hits him. \n\u201cWhy, did you get something?\u201d \n\n\u201cBurn medicine,\u201d I say almost sheepishly. \u201cOh, and some \nbread.\u201d \n\n\u201cI always knew you were his favorite,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cPlease, he can\u2019t stand being in the same room with me,\u201d I \n\nsay. \n\u201cBecause you\u2019re just alike,\u201d mutters Peeta. I ignore it \n\nthough because this really isn\u2019t the time for me to be insulting \nHaymitch, which is my first impulse. \n\nI let Peeta doze off while his clothes dry out, but by late af-\nternoon, I don\u2019t dare wait any longer. I gently shake his shoul-\nder. \u201cPeeta, we\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d \n\n\u201cGo?\u201d He seems confused. \u201cGo where?\u201d \n\u201cAway from here. Downstream maybe. Somewhere we can \n\nhide you until you\u2019re stronger,\u201d I say. I help him dress, leaving \nhis feet bare so we can walk in the water, and pull him \nupright. His face drains of color the moment he puts weight on \nhis leg. \u201cCome on. You can do this.\u201d \n\nBut he can\u2019t. Not for long anyway. We make it about fifty \nyards downstream, with him propped up by my shoulder, and \nI can tell he\u2019s going to black out. I sit him on the bank, push his \nhead between his knees, and pat his back awkwardly as I sur-\nvey the area. Of course, I\u2019d love to get him up in a tree, but \nthat\u2019s not going to happen. It could be worse though. Some of \nthe rocks form small cavelike structures. I set my sights on \none about twenty yards above the stream. When Peeta\u2019s able \nto stand, I half-guide, half-carry him up to the cave. Really, I\u2019d \n\n\n\n \n\n256 \n \n\nlike to look around for a better place, but this one will have to \ndo because my ally is shot. Paper white, panting, and, even \nthough it\u2019s only just cooling off, he\u2019s shivering. \n\nI cover the floor of the cave with a layer of pine needles, \nunroll my sleeping bag, and tuck him into it. I get a couple of \npills and some water into him when he\u2019s not noticing, but he \nrefuses to eat even the fruit. Then he just lies there, his eyes \ntrained on my face as I build a sort of blind out of vines to \nconceal the mouth of the cave. The result is unsatisfactory. An \nanimal might not question it, but a human would see hands \nhad manufactured it quickly enough. I tear it down in frustra-\ntion. \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d he says. I go over to him and brush the hair back \nfrom his eyes. \u201cThanks for finding me.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou would have found me if you could,\u201d I say. His fore-\nhead\u2019s burning up. Like the medicine\u2019s having no effect at all. \nSuddenly, out of nowhere, I\u2019m scared he\u2019s going to die. \n\n\u201cYes. Look, if I don\u2019t make it back \u2014\u201d he begins. \n\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that. I didn\u2019t drain all that pus for nothing,\u201d I \n\nsay. \n\u201cI know. But just in case I don\u2019t \u2014\u201d he tries to continue. \n\u201cNo, Peeta, I don\u2019t even want to discuss it,\u201d I say, placing my \n\nfingers on his lips to quiet him. \n\u201cBut I \u2014\u201d he insists. \nImpulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his \n\nwords. This is probably overdue anyway since he\u2019s right, we \nare supposed to be madly in love. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever \nkissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression I \n\n\n\n \n\n257 \n \n\nguess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are \nfrom the fever. I break away and pull the edge of the sleeping \nbag up around him. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die. I forbid it. All \nright?\u201d \n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he whispers. \nI step out in the cool evening air just as the parachute floats \n\ndown from the sky. My fingers quickly undo the tie, hoping for \nsome real medicine to treat Peeta\u2019s leg. Instead I find a pot of \nhot broth. \n\nHaymitch couldn\u2019t be sending me a clearer message. One \nkiss equals one pot of broth. I can almost hear his snarl. \n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be in love, sweetheart. The boy\u2019s dying. \nGive me something I can work with!\u201d \n\nAnd he\u2019s right. If I want to keep Peeta alive, I\u2019ve got to give \nthe audience something more to care about. Star-crossed lov-\ners desperate to get home together. Two hearts beating as \none. Romance. \n\nNever having been in love, this is going to be a real trick. I \nthink of my parents. The way my father never failed to bring \nher gifts from the woods. The way my mother\u2019s face would \nlight up at the sound of his boots at the door. The way she al-\nmost stopped living when he died. \n\n\u201cPeeta!\u201d I say, trying for the special tone that my mother \nused only with my father. He\u2019s dozed off again, but I kiss him \nawake, which seems to startle him. Then he smiles as if he\u2019d \nbe happy to lie there gazing at me forever. He\u2019s great at this \nstuff. \n\nI hold up the pot. \u201cPeeta, look what Haymitch has sent you.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n258 \n \n\n \n \n \nGetting the broth into Peeta takes an hour of coaxing, beg-\n\nging, threatening, and yes, kissing, but finally, sip by sip, he \nempties the pot. I let him drift off to sleep then and attend to \nmy own needs, wolfing down a supper of groosling and roots \nwhile I watch the daily report in the sky. No new casualties. \nStill, Peeta and I have given the audience a fairly interesting \nday. Hopefully, the Gamemakers will allow us a peaceful night. \n\nI automatically look around for a good tree to nest in before \nI realize that\u2019s over. At least for a while. I can\u2019t very well leave \nPeeta unguarded on the ground. I left the scene of his last hid-\ning place on the bank of the stream untouched \u2014 how could I \nconceal it? \u2014 and we\u2019re a scant fifty yards downstream. I put \non my glasses, place my weapons in readiness, and settle \ndown to keep watch. \n\nThe temperature drops rapidly and soon I\u2019m chilled to the \nbone. Eventually, I give in and slide into the sleeping bag with \nPeeta. It\u2019s toasty warm and I snuggle down gratefully until I \nrealize it\u2019s more than warm, it\u2019s overly hot because the bag is \nreflecting back his fever. I check his forehead and find it burn-\ning and dry. I don\u2019t know what to do. Leave him in the bag and \nhope the excessive heat breaks the fever? Take him out and \nhope the night air cools him off? I end up just dampening a \n\n\n\n \n\n259 \n \n\nstrip of bandage and placing it on his forehead. It seems weak, \nbut I\u2019m afraid to do anything too drastic. \n\nI spend the night half-sitting, half-lying next to Peeta, re-\nfreshing the bandage, and trying not to dwell on the fact that \nby teaming up with him, I\u2019ve made myself far more vulnerable \nthan when I was alone. Tethered to the ground, on guard, with \na very sick person to take care of. But I knew he was injured. \nAnd still I came after him. I\u2019m just going to have to trust that \nwhatever instinct sent me to find him was a good one. \n\nWhen the sky turns rosy, I notice the sheen of sweat on \nPeeta\u2019s lip and discover the fever has broken. He\u2019s not back to \nnormal, but it\u2019s come down a few degrees. Last night, when I \nwas gathering vines, I came upon a bush of Rue\u2019s berries. I \nstrip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold wa-\nter. \n\nPeeta\u2019s struggling to get up when I reach the cave. \u201cI woke \nup and you were gone,\u201d he says. \u201cI was worried about you.\u201d \n\nI have to laugh as I ease him back down. \u201cYou were worried \nabout me? Have you taken a look at yourself lately?\u201d \n\n\u201cI thought Cato and Clove might have found you. They like \nto hunt at night,\u201d he says, still serious. \n\n\u201cClove? Which one is that?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThe girl from District Two. She\u2019s still alive, right?\u201d he says. \n\u201cYes, there\u2019s just them and us and Thresh and Foxface,\u201d I \n\nsay. \u201cThat\u2019s what I nicknamed the girl from Five. How do you \nfeel?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n260 \n \n\n\u201cBetter than yesterday. This is an enormous improvement \nover the mud,\u201d he says. \u201cClean clothes and medicine and a \nsleeping bag . . . and you.\u201d \n\nOh, right, the whole romance thing. I reach out to touch his \ncheek and he catches my hand and presses it against his lips. I \nremember my father doing this very thing to my mother and I \nwonder where Peeta picked it up. Surely not from his father \nand the witch. \n\n\u201cNo more kisses for you until you\u2019ve eaten,\u201d I say. \nWe get him propped up against the wall and he obediently \n\nswallows the spoonfuls of the berry mush I feed him. He re-\nfuses the groosling again, though. \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Peeta says. \n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I say. But the truth is, I\u2019m exhausted. \n\u201cSleep now. I\u2019ll keep watch. I\u2019ll wake you if anything hap-\n\npens,\u201d he says. I hesitate. \u201cKatniss, you can\u2019t stay up forever.\u201d \nHe\u2019s got a point there. I\u2019ll have to sleep eventually. And \n\nprobably better to do it now when he seems relatively alert \nand we have daylight on our side. \u201cAll right,\u201d I say. \u201cBut just \nfor a few hours. Then you wake me.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s too warm for the sleeping bag now. I smooth it out on \nthe cave floor and lie down, one hand on my loaded bow in \ncase I have to shoot at a moment\u2019s notice. Peeta sits beside \nme, leaning against the wall, his bad leg stretched out before \nhim, his eyes trained on the world outside. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he \nsays softly. His hand brushes the loose strands of my hair off \nmy forehead. Unlike the staged kisses and caresses so far, this \ngesture seems natural and comforting. I don\u2019t want him to \n\n\n\n \n\n261 \n \n\nstop and he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s still stroking my hair when I fall as-\nleep. \n\nToo long. I sleep too long. I know from the moment I open \nmy eyes that we\u2019re into the afternoon. Peeta\u2019s right beside me, \nhis position unchanged. I sit up, feeling somehow defensive \nbut better rested than I\u2019ve been in days. \n\n\u201cPeeta, you were supposed to wake me after a couple of \nhours,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cFor what? Nothing\u2019s going on here,\u201d he says. \u201cBesides I like \nwatching you sleep. You don\u2019t scowl. Improves your looks a \nlot.\u201d \n\nThis, of course, brings on a scowl that makes him grin. \nThat\u2019s when I notice how dry his lips are. I test his cheek. Hot \nas a coal stove. He claims he\u2019s been drinking, but the contain-\ners still feel full to me. I give him more fever pills and stand \nover him while he drinks first one, then a second quart of wa-\nter. Then I tend to his minor wounds, the burns, the stings, \nwhich are showing improvement. I steel myself and unwrap \nthe leg. \n\nMy heart drops into my stomach. It\u2019s worse, much worse. \nThere\u2019s no more pus in evidence, but the swelling has in-\ncreased and the tight shiny skin is inflamed. Then I see the red \nstreaks starting to crawl up his leg. Blood poisoning. Un-\nchecked, it will kill him for sure. My chewed-up leaves and \nointment won\u2019t make a dent in it. We\u2019ll need strong anti-\ninfection drugs from the Capitol. I can\u2019t imagine the cost of \nsuch potent medicine. If Haymitch pooled every donation \nfrom every sponsor, would he have enough? I doubt it. Gifts go \n\n\n\n \n\n262 \n \n\nup in price the longer the Games continue. What buys a full \nmeal on day one buys a cracker on day twelve. And the kind of \nmedicine Peeta needs would have been at a premium from the \nbeginning. \n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s more swelling, but the pus is gone,\u201d I say in \nan unsteady voice. \n\n\u201cI know what blood poisoning is, Katniss,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cEven if my mother isn\u2019t a healer.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just going to have to outlast the others, Peeta. \nThey\u2019ll cure it back at the Capitol when we win,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s a good plan,\u201d he says. But I feel this is mostly for \nmy benefit. \n\n\u201cYou have to eat. Keep your strength up. I\u2019m going to make \nyou soup,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t light a fire,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I say. As I take the pot down to the stream, I\u2019m \n\nstruck by how brutally hot it is. I swear the Gamemakers are \nprogressively ratcheting up the temperature in the daytime \nand sending it plummeting at night. The heat of the sun-baked \nstones by the stream gives me an idea though. Maybe I won\u2019t \nneed to light a fire. \n\nI settle down on a big flat rock halfway between the stream \nand the cave. After purifying half a pot of water, I place it in \ndirect sunlight and add several egg-size hot stones to the wa-\nter. I\u2019m the first to admit I\u2019m not much of a cook. But since \nsoup mainly involves tossing everything in a pot and waiting, \nit\u2019s one of my better dishes. I mince groosling until it\u2019s practi-\ncally mush and mash some of Rue\u2019s roots. Fortunately, they\u2019ve \n\n\n\n \n\n263 \n \n\nboth been roasted already so they mostly need to be heated \nup. Already, between the sunlight and the rocks, the water\u2019s \nwarm. I put in the meat and roots, swap in fresh rocks, and go \nfind something green to spice it up a little. Before long, I dis-\ncover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. Per-\nfect. I chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out \nthe rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. \n\nI\u2019ve seen very few signs of game around, but I don\u2019t feel \ncomfortable leaving Peeta alone while I hunt, so I rig half a \ndozen snares and hope I get lucky. I wonder about the other \ntributes, how they\u2019re managing now that their main source of \nfood has been blown up. At least three of them, Cato, Clove, \nand Foxface, had been relying on it. Probably not Thresh \nthough. I\u2019ve got a feeling he must share some of Rue\u2019s know-\nledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. Are they fighting \neach other? Looking for us? Maybe one of them has located us \nand is just waiting for the right moment to attack. The idea \nsends me back to the cave. \n\nPeeta\u2019s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the \nshade of the rocks. Although he brightens a bit when I come \nin, it\u2019s clear he feels miserable. I put cool cloths on his head, \nbut they warm up almost as soon as they touch his skin. \n\n\u201cDo you want anything?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cThank you. Wait, yes. Tell me a story.\u201d \n\u201cA story? What about?\u201d I say. I\u2019m not much for storytelling. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like singing. But once in a while, Prim wheedles \none out of me. \n\n\n\n \n\n264 \n \n\n\u201cSomething happy. Tell me about the happiest day you can \nremember,\u201d says Peeta. \n\nSomething between a sigh and a huff of exasperation leaves \nmy mouth. A happy story? This will require a lot more effort \nthan the soup. I rack my brains for good memories. Most of \nthem involve Gale and me out hunting and somehow I don\u2019t \nthink these will play well with either Peeta or the audience. \nThat leaves Prim. \n\n\u201cDid I ever tell you about how I got Prim\u2019s goat?\u201d I ask. Pee-\nta shakes his head, and looks at me expectantly. So I begin. But \ncarefully. Because my words are going out all over Panem. \nAnd while people have no doubt put two and two together \nthat I hunt illegally, I don\u2019t want to hurt Gale or Greasy Sae or \nthe butcher or even the Peacekeepers back home who are my \ncustomers by publicly announcing they\u2019d breaking the law, \ntoo. \n\nHere\u2019s the real story of how I got the money for Prim\u2019s goat, \nLady. It was a Friday evening, the day before Prim\u2019s tenth \nbirthday in late May. As soon as school ended, Gale and I hit \nthe woods, because I wanted to get enough to trade for a \npresent for Prim. Maybe some new cloth for a dress or a hair-\nbrush. Our snares had done well enough and the woods were \nflush with greens, but this was really no more than our aver-\nage Friday-night haul. I was disappointed as we headed back, \neven though Gale said we\u2019d be sure to do better tomorrow. We \nwere resting a moment by a stream when we saw him. A \nyoung buck, probably a yearling by his size. His antlers were \n\n\n\n \n\n265 \n \n\njust growing in, still small and coated in velvet. Poised to run \nbut unsure of us, unfamiliar with humans. Beautiful. \n\nLess beautiful perhaps when the two arrows caught him, \none in the neck, the other in the chest. Gale and I had shot at \nthe same time. The buck tried to run but stumbled, and Gale\u2019s \nknife slit his throat before he knew what had happened. Mo-\nmentarily, I\u2019d felt a pang at killing something so fresh and in-\nnocent. And then my stomach rumbled at the thought of all \nthat fresh and innocent meat. \n\nA deer! Gale and I have only brought down three in all. The \nfirst one, a doe that had injured her leg somehow, almost \ndidn\u2019t count. But we knew from that experience not to go \ndragging the carcass into the Hob. It had caused chaos with \npeople bidding on parts and actually trying to hack off pieces \nthemselves. Greasy Sae had intervened and sent us with our \ndeer to the butcher, but not before it\u2019d been badly damaged, \nhunks of meat taken, the hide riddled with holes. Although \neverybody paid up fairly, it had lowered the value of the kill. \n\nThis time, we waited until dark fell and slipped under a \nhole in the fence close to the butcher. Even though we were \nknown hunters, it wouldn\u2019t have been good to go carrying a \n150-pound deer through the streets of District 12 in daylight \nlike we were rubbing it in the officials\u2019 faces. \n\nThe butcher, a short, chunky woman named Rooba, came to \nthe back door when we knocked. You don\u2019t haggle with Rooba. \nShe gives you one price, which you can take or leave, but it\u2019s a \nfair price. We took her offer on the deer and she threw in a \ncouple of venison steaks we could pick up after the butcher-\n\n\n\n \n\n266 \n \n\ning. Even with the money divided in two, neither Gale nor I \nhad held so much at one time in our lives. We decided to keep \nit a secret and surprise our families with the meat and money \nat the end of the next day. \n\nThis is where I really got the money for the goat, but I tell \nPeeta I sold an old silver locket of my mother\u2019s. That can\u2019t hurt \nanyone. Then I pick up the story in the late afternoon of Prim\u2019s \nbirthday. \n\nGale and I went to the market on the square so that I could \nbuy dress materials. As I was running my fingers over a length \nof thick blue cotton cloth, something caught my eye. There\u2019s \nan old man who keeps a small herd of goats on the other side \nof the Seam. I don\u2019t know his real name, everyone just calls \nhim the Goat Man. His joints are swollen and twisted in pain-\nful angles, and he\u2019s got a hacking cough that proves he spent \nyears in the mines. But he\u2019s lucky. Somewhere along the way \nhe saved up enough for these goats and now has something to \ndo in his old age besides slowly starve to death. He\u2019s filthy and \nimpatient, but the goats are clean and their milk is rich if you \ncan afford it. \n\nOne of the goats, a white one with black patches, was lying \ndown in a cart. It was easy to see why. Something, probably a \ndog, had mauled her shoulder and infection had set in. It was \nbad, the Goat Man had to hold her up to milk her. But I \nthought I knew someone who could fix it. \n\n\u201cGale,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI want that goat for Prim.\u201d \nOwning a nanny goat can change your life in District 12. \n\nThe animals can live off almost anything, the Meadow\u2019s a per-\n\n\n\n \n\n267 \n \n\nfect feeding place, and they can give four quarts of milk a day. \nTo drink, to make into cheese, to sell. It\u2019s not even against the \nlaw. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s hurt pretty bad,\u201d said Gale. \u201cWe better take a closer \nlook.\u201d \n\nWe went over and bought a cup of milk to share, then stood \nover the goat as if idly curious. \n\n\u201cLet her be,\u201d said the man. \n\u201cJust looking,\u201d said Gale. \n\u201cWell, look fast. She goes to the butcher soon. Hardly any-\n\none will buy her milk, and then they only pay half price,\u201d said \nthe man. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the butcher giving for her?\u201d I asked. \nThe man shrugged. \u201cHang around and see.\u201d I turned and \n\nsaw Rooba coming across the square toward us. \u201cLucky thing \nyou showed up,\u201d said the Goat Man when she arrived. \u201cGirl\u2019s \ngot her eye on your goat.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot if she\u2019s spoken for,\u201d I said carelessly. \nRooba looked me up and down then frowned at the goat. \n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not. Look at that shoulder. Bet you half the carcass will \nbe too rotten for even sausage.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said the Goat Man. \u201cWe had a deal.\u201d \n\u201cWe had a deal on an animal with a few teeth marks. Not \n\nthat thing. Sell her to the girl if she\u2019s stupid enough to take \nher,\u201d said Rooba. As she marched off, I caught her wink. \n\nThe Goat Man was mad, but he still wanted that goal off his \nhands. It took us half an hour to agree on the price. Quite a \ncrowd had gathered by then to hand out opinions. It was an \n\n\n\n \n\n268 \n \n\nexcellent deal if the goat lived; I\u2019d been robbed if she died. \nPeople took sides in the argument, but I took the goat. \n\nGale offered to carry her. I think he wanted to see the look \non Prim\u2019s face as much as I did. In a moment of complete gid-\ndiness, I bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. \nThen we hurried back to my house. \n\nYou should have seen Prim\u2019s reaction when we walked in \nwith that goat. Remember this is a girl who wept to save that \nawful old cat, Buttercup. She was so excited she started crying \nand laughing all at once. My mother was less sure, seeing the \ninjury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up \nherbs and coaxing brews down the animal\u2019s throat. \n\n\u201cThey sound like you,\u201d says Peeta. I had almost forgotten he \nwas there. \n\n\u201cOh, no, Peeta. They work magic. That thing couldn\u2019t have \ndied if it tried,\u201d I say. But then I bite my tongue, realizing what \nthat must sound like to Peeta, who is dying, in my incompe-\ntent hands. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not trying,\u201d he jokes. \u201cFinish the story.\u201d \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it. Only I remember that night, Prim insisted on \n\nsleeping with Lady on a blanket next to the fire. And just be-\nfore they drifted off, the goat licked her cheek, like it was giv-\ning her a good night kiss or something,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was already \nmad about her.\u201d \n\n\u201cWas it still wearing the pink ribbon?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cI think so,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to get a picture,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cI can \n\nsee why that day made you happy.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n269 \n \n\n\u201cWell, I knew that goat would be a little gold mine,\u201d 1 say. \n\u201cYes, of course I was referring to that, not the lasting joy \n\nyou gave the sister you love so much you took her place in the \nreaping,\u201d says Peeta drily. \n\n\u201cThe goat has paid for itself. Several times over,\u201d I say in a \nsuperior tone. \n\n\u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t dare do anything else after you saved its \nlife,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cI intend to do the same thing.\u201d \n\n\u201cReally? What did you cost me again?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cA lot of trouble. Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll get it all back,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense,\u201d I say. I test his forehead. The \n\nlever\u2019s going nowhere but up. \u201cYou\u2019re a little cooler though.\u201d \nThe sound of the trumpets startles me. I\u2019m on my feet and \n\nat the mouth of the cave in a flash, not wanting to miss a sylla-\nble. It\u2019s my new best friend, Claudius Templesmith, and as I \nexpected, he\u2019s inviting us to a feast. Well, we\u2019re not that hun-\ngry and I actually wave his offer away in indifference when he \nsays, \u201cNow hold on. Some of you may already be declining my \ninvitation. But this is no ordinary feast. Each of you needs \nsomething desperately.\u201d \n\nI do need something desperately. Something to heal Peeta\u2019s \nleg. \n\n\u201cEach of you will find that something in a backpack, marked \nwith your district number, at the Cornucopia at dawn. Think \nhard about refusing to show up. For some of you, this will be \nyour last chance,\u201d says Claudius. \n\n\n\n \n\n270 \n \n\nThere\u2019s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. I \njump as Peeta grips my shoulder from behind. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \n\u201cYou\u2019re not risking your life for me.\u201d \n\n\u201cWho said I was?\u201d I say. \n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not going?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m not going. Give me some credit. Do you think \n\nI\u2019m running straight into some free-for-all against Cato and \nClove and Thresh? Don\u2019t be stupid,\u201d I say, helping him back to \nbed. \u201cI\u2019ll let them fight it out, we\u2019ll see who\u2019s in the sky tomor-\nrow night and work out a plan from there.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a bad liar, Katniss. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve \nsurvived this long.\u201d He begins to mimic me. \u201cI knew that goat \n\nwould be a little gold mine. You\u2019re a little cooler though. Of \n\ncourse, I\u2019m not going. He shakes his head. \u201cNever gamble at \ncards. You\u2019ll lose your last coin,\u201d he says. \n\nAnger flushes my face. \u201cAll right, I am going, and you can\u2019t \nstop me!\u201d \n\n\u201cI can follow you. At least partway. I may not make it to the \nCornucopia, but if I\u2019m yelling your name, I bet someone can \nfind me. And then I\u2019ll be dead for sure,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t get a hundred yards from here on that leg,\u201d I \nsay. \n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll drag myself,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cYou go and I\u2019m going, \ntoo.\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s just stubborn enough and maybe just strong enough to \ndo it. Come howling after me in the woods. Even if a tribute \ndoesn\u2019t find him, something else might. He can\u2019t defend him-\n\n\n\n \n\n271 \n \n\nself. I\u2019d probably have to wall him up in the cave just to go my-\nself. And who knows what the exertion will do to him? \n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Sit here and watch you die?\u201d I \nsay. He must know that\u2019s not an option. That the audience \nwould hate me. And frankly, I would hate myself, too, if I \ndidn\u2019t even try. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t die. I promise. If you promise not to go,\u201d he says. \nWe\u2019re at something of a stalemate. I know I can\u2019t argue him \n\nout of this one, so I don\u2019t try. I pretend, reluctantly, to go \nalong. \u201cThen you have to do what I say. Drink your water, \nwake me when I tell you, and eat every bite of the soup no \nmatter how disgusting it is!\u201d I snap at him. \n\n\u201cAgreed. Is it ready?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cWait here,\u201d I say. The air\u2019s gone cold even though the sun\u2019s \n\nstill up. I\u2019m right about the Gamemakers messing with the \ntemperature. I wonder if the thing someone needs desperately \nis a good blanket. The soup is still nice and warm in its iron \npot. And actually doesn\u2019t taste too bad. \n\nPeeta eats without complaint, even scraping out the pot to \nshow his enthusiasm. He rambles on about how delicious it is, \nwhich should be encouraging if you don\u2019t know what fever \ndoes to people. He\u2019s like listening to Haymitch before the al-\ncohol has soaked him into incoherence. I give him another \ndose of fever medicine before he goes off his head completely. \n\nAs I go down to the stream to wash up, all I can think is that \nhe\u2019s going to die if I don\u2019t get to that feast. I\u2019ll keep him going \nfor a day or two, and then the infection will reach his heart or \n\n\n\n \n\n272 \n \n\nhis brain or his lungs and he\u2019ll be gone. And I\u2019ll be here all \nalone. Again. Waiting for the others. \n\nI\u2019m so lost in thought that I almost miss the parachute, even \nthough it floats right by me. Then I spring after it, yanking it \nfrom the water, tearing off the silver fabric to retrieve the vial. \nHaymitch has done it! He\u2019s gotten the medicine \u2014 I don\u2019t \nknow how, persuaded some gaggle of romantic fools to sell \ntheir jewels \u2014 and I can save Peeta! It\u2019s such a tiny vial \nthough. It must be very strong to cure someone as ill as Peeta. \nA ripple of doubt runs through me. I uncork the vial and take a \ndeep sniff. My spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. Just to be \nsure, I place a drop on the tip of my tongue. There\u2019s no ques-\ntion, it\u2019s sleep syrup. It\u2019s a common medicine in District 12. \nCheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. Almost every-\none\u2019s had a dose at one time or another. We have some in a \nbottle at home. My mother gives it to hysterical patients to \nknock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds \nor just to help someone in pain get through the night. It only \ntakes a little. A vial this size could knock Peeta out for a full \nday, but what good is that? I\u2019m so furious I\u2019m about to throw \nHaymitch\u2019s last offering into the stream when it hits me. A full \nday? That\u2019s more than I need. \n\nI mash up a handful of berries so the taste won\u2019t be as noti-\nceable and add some mint leaves for good measure. Then I \nhead back up to the cave. \u201cI\u2019ve brought you a treat. I found a \nnew patch of berries a little farther downstream.\u201d \n\nPeeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. \nHe swallows then frowns slightly. \u201cThey\u2019re very sweet.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n273 \n \n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re sugar berries. My mother makes jam from \nthem. Haven\u2019t you ever had them before?\u201d I say, poking the \nnext spoonful in his mouth. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says, almost puzzled. \u201cBut they taste familiar. Sug-\nar berries?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, you can\u2019t get them in the market much, they only \ngrow wild,\u201d I say. Another mouthful goes down. Just one more \nto go. \n\n\u201cThey\u2019re sweet as syrup,\u201d he says, taking the last spoonful. \n\u201cSyrup.\u201d His eyes widen as he realizes the truth. I clamp my \nhand over his mouth and nose hard, forcing him to swallow \ninstead of spit. He tries to make himself vomit the stuff up, but \nit\u2019s too late, he\u2019s already losing consciousness. Even as he \nfades away, I can see in his eyes what I\u2019ve done is unforgiva-\nble. \n\nI sit back on my heels and look at him with a mixture of \nsadness and satisfaction. A stray berry stains his chin and I \nwipe it away. \u201cWho can\u2019t lie, Peeta?\u201d I say, even though he \ncan\u2019t hear me. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The rest of Panem can. \n\n\n\n \n\n274 \n \n\n  \n \n \nIn the remaining hours before nightfall, I gather rocks and \n\ndo my best to camouflage the opening of the cave. It\u2019s a slow \nand arduous process, but after a lot of sweating and shifting \nthings around, I\u2019m pretty pleased with my work, The cave now \nappears to be part of a larger pile of rocks, like so many in the \nvicinity. I can still crawl in to Peeta through a small opening, \nbut it\u2019s undetectable from the out\u00ab side. That\u2019s good, because \nI\u2019ll need to share that sleeping bag again tonight. Also, if I \ndon\u2019t make it back from the feast, Peeta will be hidden but not \nentirely imprisoned. Although I doubt he can hang on much \nlonger without medicine. If I die at the feast, District 12 isn\u2019t \nlikely to have a victor. \n\nI make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the \nstream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and \nclean my weapons. I\u2019ve nine arrows left in all. I debate leaving \nthe knife with Peeta so he\u2019ll have some protection while I\u2019m \ngone, but there\u2019s really no point. He was right about camouf-\nlage being his final defense. But I still might have use for the \nknife. Who knows what I\u2019ll encounter? \n\nHere are some things I\u2019m fairly certain of. That at least Ca-\nto, Clove, and Thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. I\u2019m \nnot sure about Foxface since direct confrontation isn\u2019t her \n\n\n\n \n\n275 \n \n\nstyle or her forte. She\u2019s even smaller than I am and unarmed, \nunless she\u2019s picked up some weapons recently. She\u2019ll probably \nbe hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. \nBut the other three . . . I\u2019m going to have my hands full. My \nability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but I know I\u2019ll \nhave to go right into the thick of things to get that backpack, \nthe one with the number 12 on it that Claudius Templesmith \nmentioned. \n\nI watch the sky, hoping for one less opponent at dawn, but \nnobody appears tonight. Tomorrow there will be faces up \nthere. Feasts always result in fatalities. \n\nI crawl into the cave, secure my glasses, and curl up next to \nPeeta. Luckily I had that good long sleep today. I have to stay \nawake. I don\u2019t really think anyone will attack our cave tonight, \nbut I can\u2019t risk missing the dawn. \n\nSo cold, so bitterly cold tonight. As if the Gamemakers have \nsent an infusion of frozen air across the arena, which may be \nexactly what they\u2019ve done. I lay next to Peeta in the bag, trying \nto absorb every bit of his fever heat. It\u2019s strange to be so phys-\nically close to someone who\u2019s so distant. Peeta might as well \nbe back in the Capitol, or in District 12, or on the moon right \nnow, he\u2019d be no harder to reach. I\u2019ve never felt lonelier since \nthe Games began. \n\nJust accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not to, \nbut I can\u2019t help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if \nthey\u2019ll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, \nwith an important event like the feast, school will probably be \ncanceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old \n\n\n\n \n\n276 \n \n\nclunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the \nsquare to watch on the big, clear screens, They\u2019ll have privacy \nat home but support in the square. People will give them a \nkind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the \nbaker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are \na team, and made good on his promise to keep my sister\u2019s bel-\nly full. \n\nSpirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely \nhave anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, \npeople are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that \nwe\u2019re together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at \nthe screens, urging us on. I see their faces \u2014 Greasy Sac and \nMadge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering \nfor us. \n\nAnd Gale. I know him. He won\u2019t be shouting and cheering. \nBut he\u2019ll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, \nand willing me to come home. I wonder if he\u2019s hoping that \nPeeta makes it as well. Gale\u2019s not my boyfriend, but would he \nbe, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away to-\ngether. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of \nsurvival away from the district? Or something more? \n\nI wonder what he makes of all this kissing. \nThrough a crack in the rocks, I watch the moon cross the \n\nsky. At what I judge to be about three hours before dawn, I \nbegin final preparations. I\u2019m careful to leave Peeta with water \nand the medical kit right beside him. Nothing else will be of \nmuch use if I don\u2019t return, and even these would only prolong \nhis life a short time. After some debate, I strip him of his jacket \n\n\n\n \n\n277 \n \n\nand zip it on over my own. He doesn\u2019t need it. Not now in the \nsleeping bag with his fever, and during the day, if I\u2019m not there \nto remove it, he\u2019ll be roasting in it. My hands are already stiff \nfrom cold, so I take Rue\u2019s spare pair of socks, cut holes for my \nfingers and thumbs, and pull them on. It helps anyway. I fill \nher small pack with some food, a water bottle, and bandages, \ntuck the knife in my belt, get my bow and arrows. I\u2019m about to \nleave when I remember the importance of sustaining the star-\ncrossed lover routine and I lean over and give Peeta a long, \nlingering kiss. I imagine the teary sighs emanating from the \nCapitol and pretend to brush away a tear of my own. Then I \nsqueeze through the opening in the rocks out into the night. \n\nMy breath makes small white clouds as it hits the air. It\u2019s as \ncold as a November night at home. One where I\u2019ve slipped into \nthe woods, lantern in hand, to join Gale at some prearranged \nplace where we\u2019ll sit bundled together, sipping herb tea from \nmetal flasks wrapped in quilting, hoping game will pass our \nway as the morning comes on. Oh, Gale, I think. If only you had \n\nmy back now . . . \n\nI move as fast as I dare. The glasses are quite remarkable, \nbut I still sorely miss having the use of my left ear. I don\u2019t \nknow what the explosion did, but it damaged something deep \nand irreparable. Never mind. If I get home, I\u2019ll be so stinking \nrich, I\u2019ll be able to pay someone to do my hearing. \n\nThe woods always look different at night. Even with the \nglasses, everything has an unfamiliar slant to it. As if the day-\ntime trees and flowers and stones had gone to bed and sent \nslightly more ominous versions of themselves to take their \n\n\n\n \n\n278 \n \n\nplaces. I don\u2019t try anything tricky, like taking a new route. I \nmake my way back up the stream and follow the same path \nback to Rue\u2019s hiding place near the lake. Along the way, I see \nno sign of another tribute, not a puff of breath, not a quiver of \na branch. Either I\u2019m the first to arrive or the others positioned \nthemselves last night. There\u2019s still more than an hour, maybe \ntwo, when I wriggle into the underbrush and wait for the \nblood to begin to flow. \n\nI chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isn\u2019t up for much \nmore. Thank goodness, I have Peeta\u2019s jacket as well as my \nown. If not, I\u2019d be forced to move around to stay warm. The \nsky turns a misty morning gray and still there\u2019s no sign of the \nother tributes. It\u2019s not surprising really. Everyone has distin-\nguished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cun-\nning. Do they suppose, I wonder, that I have Peeta with me? I \ndoubt Foxface and Thresh even know he was wounded. All the \nbetter if they think he\u2019s covering me when I go in for the \nbackpack. \n\nBut where is it? The arena has lightened enough for me to \nremove my glasses. I can hear the morning birds singing. Isn\u2019t \nit time? For a second, I\u2019m panicked that I\u2019m at the wrong loca-\ntion. But no, I\u2019m certain I remember Claudius Templesmith \nspecifying the Cornucopia. And there it is. And here I am. So \nwhere\u2019s my feast? \n\nJust as the first ray of sun glints off the gold Cornucopia, \nthere\u2019s a disturbance on the plain. The ground before the \nmouth of the horn splits in two and a round table with a \nsnowy white cloth rises into the arena. On the table sit four \n\n\n\n \n\n279 \n \n\nbackpacks, two large black ones with the numbers 2 and 11, a \nmedium-size green one with the number 5, and a tiny orange \none \u2014 really I could carry it around my wrist \u2014 that must be \nmarked with a 12. \n\nThe table has just clicked into place when a figure darts out \nof the Cornucopia, snags the green backpack, and speeds off. \nFoxface! Leave it to her to come up with such a clever and \nrisky idea! The rest of us are still poised around the plain, siz-\ning up the situation, and she\u2019s got hers. She\u2019s got us trapped, \ntoo, because no one wants to chase her down, not while their \nown pack sits so vulnerable on the table. Foxface must have \npurposefully left the other packs alone, knowing that to steal \none without her number would definitely bring on a pursuer. \nThat should have been my strategy! By the lime I\u2019ve worked \nthrough the emotions of surprise, admiration, anger, jealousy, \nand frustration, I\u2019m watching that reddish mane of hair disap-\npear into the trees well out of shooting range. Huh. I\u2019m always \ndreading the others, but maybe Foxface is the real opponent \nhere. \n\nShe\u2019s cost me time, too, because by now it\u2019s clear that I \nmust get to the table next. Anyone who beats me to it will \neasily scoop up my pack and be gone. Without hesitation, I \nsprint for the table. I can sense the emergence of danger be-\nfore I see it. Fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on \nmy right side so I can hear it and I\u2019m able to deflect it with my \nbow. I turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow \nstraight at Clove\u2019s heart. She turns just enough to avoid a fatal \nhit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. Unfortunately, \n\n\n\n \n\n280 \n \n\nshe throws with her right, but it\u2019s enough to slow her down a \nfew moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in \nthe severity of the wound. I keep moving, positioning the next \narrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for \nyears can do. \n\nI\u2019m at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny \norange backpack. My hand slips between the straps and I yank \nit up on my arm, it\u2019s really too small to fit on any other part of \nmy anatomy, and I\u2019m turning to fire again when the second \nknife catches me in the forehead. It slices above my right eye-\nbrow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, \nblinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic \ntaste of my own blood. I stagger backward but still manage to \nsend my readied arrow in the general direction of my assai-\nlant. I know as it leaves my hands it will miss. And then Clove \nslams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my \nshoulders to the ground, with her knees. \n\nThis is it, I think, and hope for Prim\u2019s sake it will be fast. But \nClove means to savor the moment. Even feels she has time. No \ndoubt Cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for \nThresh and possibly Peeta. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s your boyfriend, District Twelve? Still hanging \non?\u201d she asks. \n\nWell, as long as we\u2019re talking I\u2019m alive. \u201cHe\u2019s out there now. \nHunting Cato,\u201d I snarl at her. Then I scream at the top of my \nlungs. \u201cPeeta!\u201d \n\nClove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively cut-\nting off my voice. But her head\u2019s whipping from side to side, \n\n\n\n \n\n281 \n \n\nand I know for a moment she\u2019s at least considering I\u2019m telling \nthe truth. Since no Peeta appears to save me, she turns back to \nme. \n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cHe\u2019s nearly dead. Cato knows \nwhere he cut him. You\u2019ve probably got him strapped up in \nsome tree while you try to keep his heart going. What\u2019s in the \npretty little backpack? That medicine for Lover Boy? Too bad \nhe\u2019ll never get it.\u201d \n\nClove opens her jacket. It\u2019s lined with an impressive array \nof knives. She carefully selects an almost dainty-looking num-\nber with a cruel, curved blade. \u201cI promised Cato if he let me \nhave you, I\u2019d give the audience a good show.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but it\u2019s no use. \nShe\u2019s too heavy and her lock on me too tight. \n\n\u201cForget it, District Twelve. We\u2019re going to kill you. Just like \nwe did your pathetic little ally . . . what was her name? The \none who hopped around in the trees? Rue? Well, first Rue, \nthen you, and then I think we\u2019ll just let nature take care of \nLover Boy. How does that sound?\u201d Clove asks. \u201cNow, where to \nstart?\u201d \n\nShe carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with \nher jacket sleeve. For a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it \nfrom side to side as if it\u2019s a block of wood and she\u2019s deciding \nexactly what pattern to carve on it. I attempt to bite her hand, \nbut she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back \nto the ground. \u201cI think . . .\u201d she almost purrs. \u201cI think we\u2019ll start \nwith your mouth.\u201d I clamp my teeth together as she teasingly \ntraces the outline of my lips with the tip of the blade. \n\n\n\n \n\n282 \n \n\nI won\u2019t close my eyes. The comment about Rue has filled \nme with fury, enough fury I think to die with some dignity. As \nmy last act of defiance, I will stare her down as long as I can \nsee, which will probably not be an extended period of time, \nbut I will stare her down, I will not cry out. I will die, in my \nown small way, undefeated. \n\n\u201cYes, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have much use for your lips any-\nmore. Want to blow Lover Boy one last kiss?\u201d she asks, I work \nup a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. She \nflushes with rage. \u201cAll right then. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d \n\nI brace myself for the agony that\u2019s sure to follow. But as I \nfeel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks \nClove from my body and then she\u2019s screaming. I\u2019m too \nstunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. Has \nPeeta somehow come to my rescue? Have the Gamemakers \nsent in some wild animal to add to the fun? Has a hovercraft \ninexplicably plucked her into the air? \n\nBut when I push myself up on my numb arms, I see it\u2019s \nnone of the above. Clove is dangling a foot off the ground, im-\nprisoned in Thresh\u2019s arms. I let out a gasp, seeing him like \nthat, towering over me, holding Clove like a rag doll. I remem-\nber him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful \nthan I even recall. If anything, he seems to have gained weight \nin the arena. He flips Clove around and flings her onto the \nground. \n\nWhen he shouts, I jump, never having heard him speak \nabove a mutter. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to that little girl? You kill \nher?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n283 \n \n\nClove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic in-\nsect, too shocked to even call for Cato. \u201cNo! No, it wasn\u2019t me!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou said her name. I heard you. You kill her?\u201d Another \nthought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. \u201cYou cut \nher up like you were going to cut up this girl here?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo! No, I \u2014\u201d Clove sees the stone, about the size of a small \nloaf of bread in Thresh\u2019s hand and loses it. \u201cCato!\u201d she \nscreeches. \u201cCato!\u201d \n\n\u201cClove!\u201d I hear Cato\u2019s answer, but he\u2019s too far away, I can \ntell that much, to do her any good. What was he doing? Trying \nto get Foxface or Peeta? Or had he been lying in wait for \nThresh and just badly misjudged his location? \n\nThresh brings the rock down hard against Clove\u2019s temple. \nIt\u2019s not bleeding, but I can see the dent in her skull and I know \nthat she\u2019s a goner. There\u2019s still life in her now though, in the \nrapid rise and fall of her chest, the low moan escaping her lips. \n\nWhen Thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, I know \nit\u2019s no good to run. And my bow is empty, the last loaded ar-\nrow having gone in Clove\u2019s direction. I\u2019m trapped in the glare \nof his strange golden brown eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019d she mean? About \nRue being your ally?\u201d \n\n\u201cI \u2014 I \u2014 we teamed up. Blew up the supplies. I tried to \nsave her, I did. But he got there first. District One,\u201d I say. May-\nbe if he knows I helped Rue, he won\u2019t choose some slow, sa-\ndistic end for me. \n\n\u201cAnd you killed him?\u201d he demands. \n\u201cYes. I killed him. And buried her in flowers,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I \n\nsang her to sleep.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n284 \n \n\nTears spring in my eyes. The tension, the fight goes out of \nme at the memory. And I\u2019m overwhelmed by Rue, and the pain \nin my head, and my fear of Thresh, and the moaning of the dy-\ning girl a few feet away. \n\n\u201cTo sleep?\u201d Thresh says gruffly. \n\u201cTo death. I sang until she died,\u201d I say. \u201cYour district. . . they \n\nsent me bread.\u201d My hand reaches up but not for an arrow that \nI know I\u2019ll never reach. Just to wipe my nose. \u201cDo it fast, okay, \nThresh?\u201d \n\nConflicting emotions cross Thresh\u2019s face. He lowers the \nrock and points at me, almost accusingly. \u201cJust this one time, I \nlet you go. For the little girl. You and me, we\u2019re even then. No \nmore owed. You understand?\u201d \n\nI nod because I do understand. About owing. About hating \nit. I understand that if Thresh wins, he\u2019ll have to go back and \nface a district that has already broken all the rules to thank \nme, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. And I under-\nstand that, for the moment, Thresh is not going to smash in \nmy skull. \n\n\u201cClove!\u201d Cato\u2019s voice is much nearer now. I can tell by the \npain in it that he sees her on the ground. \n\n\u201cYou better run now, Fire Girl,\u201d says Thresh. \nI don\u2019t need to be told twice. I flip over and my feet dip into \n\nthe hard-packed earth as I run away from Thresh and Clove \nand the sound of Cato\u2019s voice. Only when I reach the woods do \nI turn back for an instant. Thresh and both large backpacks \nare vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area I\u2019ve nev-\ner seen. Cato kneels beside Clove, spear in hand, begging her \n\n\n\n \n\n285 \n \n\nto stay with him. In a moment, he will realize it\u2019s futile, she \ncan\u2019t be saved. I crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away \nthe blood that\u2019s pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, \nwounded creature I am. After a few minutes, I hear the cannon \nand I know that Clove has died, that Cato will be on one of our \ntrails. Either Thresh\u2019s or mine. I\u2019m seized with terror, weak \nfrom my head wound, shaking. I load an arrow, but Cato can \nthrow that spear almost as far as I can shoot. \n\nOnly one thing calms me down. Thresh has Cato\u2019s backpack \ncontaining the thing he needs desperately. If I had to bet, Cato \nheaded out after Thresh, not me. Still I don\u2019t slow down when \nI reach the water. I plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder \ndownstream. I pull off Rue\u2019s socks that I\u2019ve been using for \ngloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the \nflow of blood, but they\u2019re soaked in minutes. \n\nSomehow I make it back to the cave. I squeeze through the \nrocks. In the dappled light, I pull the little orange backpack \nfrom my arm, cut open the clasp, and dump the contents on \nthe ground. One slim box containing one hypodermic needle. \nWithout hesitating, I jam the needle into Peeta\u2019s arm and \nslowly press down on the plunger. \n\nMy hands go to my head and then drop to my lap, slick with \nblood. \n\nThe last thing I remember is an exquisitely beautiful green-\nand-silver moth landing on the curve of my wrist. \n\n\n\n \n\n286 \n \n\n \n \n \nThe sound of rain drumming on the roof of our house gent-\n\nly pulls me toward consciousness. I fight to return to sleep \nthough, wrapped in a warm cocoon of blankets, safe at home. \nI\u2019m vaguely aware that my head aches. Possibly I have the flu \nand this is why I\u2019m allowed to stay in bed, even though I can \ntell I\u2019ve been asleep a long time. My mother\u2019s hand strokes my \ncheek and I don\u2019t push it away as I would in wakefulness, nev-\ner wanting her to know how much I crave that gentle touch. \nHow much I miss her even though I still don\u2019t trust her. Then \nthere\u2019s a voice, the wrong voice, not my mother\u2019s, and I\u2019m \nscared. \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d it says. \u201cKatniss, can you hear me?\u201d \nMy eyes open and the sense of security vanishes. I\u2019m not \n\nhome, not with my mother. I\u2019m in a dim, chilly cave, my bare \nfeet freezing despite the cover, the air tainted with the unmis-\ntakable smell of blood. The haggard, pale face of a boy slides \ninto view, and after an initial jolt of alarm, I feel better. \u201cPee-\nta.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says. \u201cGood to see your eyes again.\u201d \n\u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d I ask. \n\n\n\n \n\n287 \n \n\n\u201cNot sure. I woke up yesterday evening and you were lying \nnext to me in a very scary pool of blood,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s \nstopped finally, but I wouldn\u2019t sit up or anything.\u201d \n\nI gingerly lift my hand to my head and find it bandaged. \nThis simple gesture leaves me weak and dizzy. Peeta holds a \nbottle to my lips and I drink thirstily. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better,\u201d I say. \n\u201cMuch better. Whatever you shot into my arm did the \n\ntrick,\u201d he says. \u201cBy this morning, almost all the swelling in my \nleg was gone.\u201d \n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem angry about my tricking him, drugging \nhim, and running off to the feast. Maybe I\u2019m just too beat-up \nand I\u2019ll hear about it later when I\u2019m stronger. But for the mo-\nment, he\u2019s all gentleness. \n\n\u201cDid you eat?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say I gobbled down three pieces of that groos-\n\nling before I realized it might have to last a while. Don\u2019t worry, \nI\u2019m back on a strict diet,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s good. You need to eat. I\u2019ll go hunting soon,\u201d I say. \n\u201cNot too soon, all right?\u201d he says. \u201cYou just let me take care \n\nof you for a while.\u201d \nI don\u2019t really seem to have much choice. Peeta feeds me bi-\n\ntes of groosling and raisins and makes me drink plenty of wa-\nter. He rubs some warmth back into my feet and wraps them \nin his jacket before tucking the sleeping bag back up around \nmy chin. \n\n\u201cYour boots and socks are still damp and the weather\u2019s not \nhelping much,\u201d he says. There\u2019s a clap of thunder, and I see \n\n\n\n \n\n288 \n \n\nlightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. \nRain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but Peeta has \nbuilt a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging \nthe square of plastic into the rock above me. \n\n\u201cI wonder what brought on this storm? I mean, who\u2019s the \ntarget?\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cCato and Thresh,\u201d I say without thinking. \u201cFoxface will be \nin her den somewhere, and Clove . . . she cut me an then . . .\u201d \nMy voice trails off. \n\n\u201cI know Clove\u2019s dead. I saw it in the sky last night,\u201d h says. \n\u201cDid you kill her?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. Thresh broke her skull with a rock,\u201d I say. \n\u201cLucky he didn\u2019t catch you, too,\u201d says Peeta. \nThe memory of the feast returns full-force and I feel sick. \n\n\u201cHe did. But he let me go.\u201d Then, of course, I have to tell him. \nAbout things I\u2019ve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask \nand I wasn\u2019t ready to relive anyway. Like the explosion and \nmy ear and Rue\u2019s dying and the boy from District 1 and the \nbread. All of which leads to what happened with Thresh and \nhow he was paying off a debt of sorts. \n\n\u201cHe let you go because he didn\u2019t want to owe you any-\nthing?\u201d asks Peeta in disbelief. \n\n\u201cYes. I don\u2019t expect you to understand it. You\u2019ve always had \nenough. But if you\u2019d lived in the Seam, I wouldn\u2019t have to ex-\nplain,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t try. Obviously I\u2019m too dim to get it.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s like the bread. How I never seem to get over owing you \n\nfor that,\u201d I say. \n\n\n\n \n\n289 \n \n\n\u201cThe bread? What? From when we were kids?\u201d he says. \u201cI \nthink we can let that go. I mean, you just brought me back \nfrom the dead.\u201d \n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t know me. We had never even spoken. Be-\nsides, it\u2019s the first gift that\u2019s always the hardest to pay back. I \nwouldn\u2019t even have been here to do it if you hadn\u2019t helped me \nthen,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy did you, anyway?\u201d \n\n\u201cWhy? You know why,\u201d Peeta says. I give my head a slight, \npainful shake. \u201cHaymitch said you would take a lot of convinc-\ning.\u201d \n\n\u201cHaymitch?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat\u2019s he got to do with it?\u201d \n\u201cNothing,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cSo, Cato and Thresh, huh? I guess \n\nit\u2019s too much to hope that they\u2019ll simultaneously destroy each \nother?\u201d \n\nBut the thought only upsets me. \u201cI think we would like \nThresh. I think he\u2019d be our friend back in District Twelve,\u201d I \nsay. \n\n\u201cThen let\u2019s hope Cato kills him, so we don\u2019t have to,\u201d says \nPeeta grimly. \n\nI don\u2019t want Cato to kill Thresh at all. I don\u2019t want anyone \nelse to die. But this is absolutely not the kind of thing that vic-\ntors go around saying in the arena. Despite my best efforts, I \ncan feel tears starting to pool in my eyes. \n\nPeeta looks at me in concern. \u201cWhat is it? Are you in a lot of \npain?\u201d \n\nI give him another answer, because it is equally true but \ncan be taken as a brief moment of weakness instead of a ter-\n\n\n\n \n\n290 \n \n\nminal one. \u201cI want to go home, Peeta,\u201d I say plaintively, like a \nsmall child. \n\n\u201cYou will. I promise,\u201d he says, and bends over to give me a \nkiss. \n\n\u201cI want to go home now,\u201d I say. \n\u201cTell you what. You go back to sleep and dream of home. \n\nAnd you\u2019ll be there for real before you know it,\u201d lie says. \n\u201cOkay?\u201d \n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWake me if you need me to keep watch.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m good and rested, thanks to you and Haymitch. Besides, \n\nwho knows how long this will last?\u201d he says. \nWhat does he mean? The storm? The brief respite ii brings \n\nus? The Games themselves? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m ion sad and \ntired to ask. \n\nIt\u2019s evening when Peeta wakes me again. The rain has \nturned to a downpour, sending streams of water through our \nceiling where earlier there had been only drips. Peeta has \nplaced the broth pot under the worst one and repositioned the \nplastic to deflect most of it from me. I feel a bit better, able to \nsit up without getting too dizzy, and I\u2019m absolutely famished. \nSo is Peeta. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s been waiting for me to wake up to \neat and is eager to get started. \n\nThere\u2019s not much left. Two pieces of groosling, a small \nmishmash of roots, and a handful of dried fruit. \n\n\u201cShould we try and ration it?\u201d Peeta asks. \n\u201cNo, let\u2019s just finish it. The groosling\u2019s getting old anyway, \n\nand the last thing we need is to get sick off spoilt food,\u201d I say, \ndividing the food into two equal piles. We try and eat slowly, \n\n\n\n \n\n291 \n \n\nbut we\u2019re both so hungry were done in a couple of minutes. \nMy stomach is in no way satisfied. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s a hunting \nday,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be much help with that,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cI\u2019ve never \nhunted before.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill and you cook,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you can always gather.\u201d \n\u201cI wish there was some sort of bread bush out there,\u201d says \n\nPeeta. \n\u201cThe bread they sent me from District Eleven was still \n\nwarm,\u201d I say with a sigh. \u201cHere, chew these.\u201d I hand him a \ncouple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but it\u2019s clear \nenough to know there were no more deaths today. So Cato \nand Thresh haven\u2019t had it out yet. \n\n\u201cWhere did Thresh go? I mean, what\u2019s on the far side of the \ncircle?\u201d I ask Peeta. \n\n\u201cA field. As far as you can see it\u2019s full of grasses as high as \nmy shoulders. I don\u2019t know, maybe some of them are grain. \nThere are patches of different colors. But there are no paths,\u201d \nsays Peeta. \n\n\u201cI bet some of them are grain. I bet Thresh knows which \nones, too,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you go in there?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. Nobody really wanted to track Thresh down in that \ngrass. It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that \nfield, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid an-\nimals, and quicksand,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cThere could be anything in \nthere.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n292 \n \n\nI don\u2019t say so but Peeta\u2019s words remind me of the warnings \nthey give us about not going beyond the fence in District 12. I \ncan\u2019t help, for a moment, comparing him with Gale, who \nwould see that field as a potential source of food as well as a \nthreat. Thresh certainly did. It\u2019s not that Peeta\u2019s soft exactly, \nand he\u2019s proved he\u2019s not a coward. But there are things you \ndon\u2019t question too much, I guess, when your home always \nsmells like baking bread, whereas Gale questions everything. \nWhat would Peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes \nbetween us as we break the law each day? Would it shock \nhim? The things we say about Panem? Gale\u2019s tirades against \nthe Capitol? \n\n\u201cMaybe there is a bread bush in that field,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe \nthat\u2019s why Thresh looks better fed now than when we started \nthe Games.\u201d \n\n\u201cEither that or he\u2019s got very generous sponsors,\u201d says Pee-\nta. \u201cI wonder what we\u2019d have to do to get Haymitch to send us \nsome bread.\u201d \n\nI raise my eyebrows before I remember he doesn\u2019t know \nabout the message Haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. \nOne kiss equals one pot of broth. It\u2019s not the sort of thing I can \nblurt out, either. To say my thoughts aloud would be tipping \noff the audience that the romance has been fabricated to play \non their sympathies and that would result in no food at all. \nSomehow, believably, I\u2019ve got to get things back on track. \nSomething simple to start with. I reach out and take his hand. \n\n\u201cWell, he probably used up a lot of resources helping me \nknock you out,\u201d I say mischievously. \n\n\n\n \n\n293 \n \n\n\u201cYeah, about that,\u201d says Peeta, entwining his fingers in \nmine. \u201cDon\u2019t try something like that again.\u201d \n\n\u201cOr what?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cOr . . . or . . .\u201d He can\u2019t think of anything good. \u201cJust give me \n\na minute.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I say with a grin. \n\u201cThe problem is we\u2019re both still alive. Which only rein-\n\nforces the idea in your mind that you did the right thing,\u201d says \nPeeta. \n\n\u201cI did do the right thing,\u201d I say. \n\u201cNo! Just don\u2019t, Katniss!\u201d His grip tightens, hurting my hand, \n\nand there\u2019s real anger in his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t die for me. You \nwon\u2019t be doing me any favors. All right?\u201d \n\nI\u2019m startled by his intensity but recognize an excellent op-\nportunity for getting food, so I try to keep up. \u201cMaybe I did it \nfor myself, Peeta, did you ever think of that? Maybe you aren\u2019t \nthe only one who . . . who worries about . . . what it would be \nlike if. . .\u201d \n\nI fumble. I\u2019m not as smooth with words as Peeta. And while \nI was talking, the idea of actually losing Peeta hit me again and \nI realized how much I don\u2019t want him to die. And it\u2019s not about \nthe sponsors. And it\u2019s not about what will happen back home. \nAnd it\u2019s not just that I don\u2019t want to be alone. It\u2019s him. I do not \nwant to lose the boy with the bread. \n\n\u201cIf what, Katniss?\u201d he says softly. \nI wish I could pull the shutters closed, blocking out this \n\nmoment from the prying eyes of Panem. Even if it means los-\ning food. Whatever I\u2019m feeling, it\u2019s no one\u2019s business but mine. \n\n\n\n \n\n294 \n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly the kind of topic Haymitch told me to steer \nclear of,\u201d I say evasively, although Haymitch never said any-\nthing of the kind. In fact, he\u2019s probably cursing me out right \nnow for dropping the ball during such an emotionally charged \nmoment. But Peeta somehow catches it. \n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll just have to fill in the blanks myself,\u201d he says, and \nmoves in to me. \n\nThis is the first kiss that we\u2019re both fully aware of. Neither \nof us hobbled by sickness or pain or simply unconscious. Our \nlips neither burning with fever or icy cold. This is the first kiss \nwhere I actually feel stirring inside my chest. Warm and cu-\nrious. This is the first kiss that makes me want another. \n\nBut I don\u2019t get it. Well, I do get a second kiss, but it\u2019s just a \nlight one on the tip of my nose because Peeta\u2019s been dis-\ntracted. \u201cI think your wound is bleeding again. Come on, lie \ndown, it\u2019s bedtime anyway,\u201d he says. \n\nMy socks are dry enough to wear now. I make Peeta put his \njacket back on. The damp cold seems to cut right down to my \nbones, so he must be half frozen. I insist on taking the first \nwatch, too, although neither of us think it\u2019s likely anyone will \ncome in this weather. But he won\u2019t agree unless I\u2019m in the bag, \ntoo, and I\u2019m shivering so hard that it\u2019s pointless to object. In \nstark contrast to two nights ago, when I felt Peeta was a mil-\nlion miles away, I\u2019m struck by his immediacy now. As we set-\ntle in, he pulls my head down to use his arm as a pillow, the \nother rests protectively over me even when he goes to sleep. \nNo one has held me like this in such a long time. Since my fa-\n\n\n\n \n\n295 \n \n\nther died and I stopped trusting my mother, no one else\u2019s \narms have made me feel this safe. \n\nWith the aid of the glasses, I lie watching the drips of water \nsplatter on the cave floor. Rhythmic and lulling. Several times, \nI drift off briefly and then snap awake, guilty and angry with \nmyself. After three or four hours, I can\u2019t help it, I have to rouse \nPeeta because I can\u2019t keep my eyes open. He doesn\u2019t seem to \nmind. \n\n\u201cTomorrow, when it\u2019s dry, I\u2019ll find us a place so high in the \ntrees we can both sleep in peace,\u201d I promise as I drift off. \n\nBut tomorrow is no better in terms of weather. The deluge \ncontinues as if the Gamemakers are intent on washing us all \naway. The thunder\u2019s so powerful it seems to shake the ground. \nPeeta\u2019s considering heading out anyway to scavenge for food, \nbut I tell him in this storm it would be pointless. He won\u2019t be \nable to see three feet in front of his face and he\u2019ll only end up \ngetting soaked to the skin for his troubles. He knows I\u2019m right, \nbut the gnawing in our stomachs is becoming painful. \n\nThe day drags on turning into evening and there\u2019s no break \nin the weather. Haymitch is our only hope, but nothing is \nforthcoming, either from lack of money \u2014 everything will cost \nan exorbitant amount \u2014 or because he\u2019s dissatisfied with our \nperformance. Probably the latter. I\u2019d be the first to admit \nwe\u2019re not exactly riveting today. Starving, weak from injuries, \ntrying not to reopen wounds. We\u2019re sitting huddled together \nwrapped in the sleeping bag, yes, but mostly to keep warm. \nThe most exciting thing either of us does is nap. \n\n\n\n \n\n296 \n \n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to ramp up the romance. The kiss \nlast night was nice, but working up to another will take some \nforethought. There are girls in the Seam, some of the mer-\nchant girls, too, who navigate these waters so easily. But I\u2019ve \nnever had much time or use for it. Anyway, just a kiss isn\u2019t \nenough anymore clearly because if it was we\u2019d have gotten \nfood last night. My instincts tell me Haymitch isn\u2019t just looking \nfor physical affection, he wants something more personal. The \nsort of stuff he was trying to get me to tell about myself when \nwe were practicing for the interview. I\u2019m rotten at it, but Pee-\nta\u2019s not. Maybe the best approach is to get him talking. \n\n\u201cPeeta,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cYou said at the interview you\u2019d had a \ncrush on me forever. When did forever start?\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, let\u2019s see. I guess the first day of school. We were five. \nYou had on a red plaid dress and your hair . . . it was in two \nbraids instead of one. My father pointed you out when we \nwere waiting to line up,\u201d Peeta says. \n\n\u201cYour father? Why?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cHe said, \u2018See that little girl? I wanted to marry her mother, \n\nbut she ran off with a coal miner,\u2019\u201d Peeta says. \n\u201cWhat? You\u2019re making that up!\u201d I exclaim. \n\u201cNo, true story,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018A coal miner? Why \n\ndid she want a coal miner if she could\u2019ve had you?\u2019 And he \nsaid, \u2018Because when he sings . . . even the birds stop to listen.\u2019\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. They do. I mean, they did,\u201d I say. I\u2019m stunned \nand surprisingly moved, thinking of the baker telling this to \nPeeta. It strikes me that my own reluctance to sing, my own \ndismissal of music might not really be that I think it\u2019s a waste \n\n\n\n \n\n297 \n \n\nof time. It might be because it reminds me too much of my fa-\nther. \n\n\u201cSo that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who \nknew the valley song. Your hand shot right up in the air. She \nstood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. And I swear, \nevery bird outside the windows fell silent,\u201d Peeta says. \n\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d I say, laughing. \n\u201cNo, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew \n\n\u2014 just like your mother \u2014 I was a goner,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cThen \nfor the next eleven years, I tried to work up the nerve to talk \nto you.\u201d \n\n\u201cWithout success,\u201d I add. \n\u201cWithout success. So, in a way, my name being drawn in the \n\nreaping was a real piece of luck,\u201d says Peeta. \nFor a moment, I\u2019m almost foolishly happy and then confu-\n\nsion sweeps over me. Because we\u2019re supposed to be making \nup this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. \nBut Peeta\u2019s story has a ring of truth to it. That part about my \nfather and the birds. And I did sing the first day of school, al-\nthough I don\u2019t remember the song. And that red plaid dress . . . \nthere was one, a hand-me-down to Prim that got washed to \nrags after my father\u2019s death. \n\nIt would explain another thing, too. Why Peeta took a beat-\ning to give me the bread on that awful hollow day. So, if those \ndetails are true . . . could it all be true? \n\n\u201cYou have a . . . remarkable memory,\u201d I say haltingly. \n\n\n\n \n\n298 \n \n\n\u201cI remember everything about you,\u201d says Peeta, tucking a \nloose strand of hair behind my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who \nwasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d \n\n\u201cI am now,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have much competition here,\u201d he says. \nI want to draw away, to close those shutters again, but I \n\nknow I can\u2019t. It\u2019s as if I can hear Haymitch whispering in my \near, \u201cSay it! Say it!\u201d \n\nI swallow hard and get the words out. \u201cYou don\u2019t have \nmuch competition anywhere.\u201d And this time, it\u2019s me who leans \nin. \n\nOur lips have just barely touched when the clunk outside \nmakes us jump. My bow comes up, the arrow ready to fly, but \nthere\u2019s no other sound. Peeta peers through the rocks and \nthen gives a whoop. Before I can stop him, lie\u2019s out in the rain, \nthen handing something in to me. A silver parachute attached \nto a basket. I rip it open at once and inside there\u2019s a feast \u2014 \nfresh rolls, goat cheese, apples, and best of all, a tureen of that \nincredible lamb stew on wild rice. The very dish I told Caesar \nFlickerman was the most impressive thing the Capitol had to \noffer. \n\nPeeta wriggles back inside, his face lit up like the sun. \u201cI \nguess Haymitch finally got tired of watching us starve.\u201d \n\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d I answer. \nBut in my head I can hear Haymitch\u2019s smug, if slightly exas-\n\nperated, words, \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking lot, sweetheart.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n299 \n \n\n \n \n \nEvery cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and \n\ncram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peeta\u2019s voice \nstops me. \u201cWe better take it slow on that stew. Remember the \nfirst night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I \nwasn\u2019t even starving then.\u201d \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. And I could just inhale the whole thing!\u201d I say \nregretfully. But I don\u2019t. We are quite sensible. We each have a \nroll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I \nmake myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls \u2014 they even sent \nus silverware and plates \u2014 savoring each bite. When we \nfinish, I stare longingly at the dish. \u201cI want more.\u201d \n\n\u201cMe, too. Tell you what. We wait an hour, if it stays down, \nthen we get another serving,\u201d Peeta says. \n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long hour.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe not that long,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cWhat was that you were \n\nsaying just before the food arrived? Something about me . . . \nno competition . . . best thing that ever happened to you . . .\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember that last part,\u201d I say, hoping it\u2019s too dim \nin here for the cameras to pick up my blush. \n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I was thinking,\u201d he says. \u201cScoot \nover, I\u2019m freezing.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n300 \n \n\nI make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back \nagainst the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms \nwrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep \nup the act. \u201cSo, since we were five, you never even noticed any \nother girls?\u201d I ask him. \n\n\u201cNo, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made \na lasting impression but you,\u201d he says. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that would thrill your parents, you liking a girl \nfrom the Seam,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cHardly. But I couldn\u2019t care less. Anyway, if we make it \nback, you won\u2019t be a girl from the Seam, you\u2019ll be a girl from \nthe Victor\u2019s Village,\u201d he says. \n\nThat\u2019s right. If we win, we\u2019ll each get a house in the part of \ntown reserved for Hunger Games\u2019 victors. Long ago, when the \nGames began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each \ndistrict. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the \nothers have never been lived in at all. \n\nA disturbing thought hits me. \u201cBut then, our only neighbor \nwill be Haymitch!\u201d \n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019ll be nice,\u201d says Peeta, tightening his arms around \nme. \u201cYou and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, \nlong winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games\u2019 \ntales.\u201d \n\n\u201cI told you, he hates me!\u201d I say, but I can\u2019t help laughing at \nthe image of Haymitch becoming my new pal. \n\n\u201cOnly sometimes. When he\u2019s sober, I\u2019ve never heard him \nsay one negative thing about you,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never sober!\u201d I protest. \n\n\n\n \n\n301 \n \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It\u2019s Cinna \nwho likes you. But that\u2019s mainly because you didn\u2019t try to run \nwhen he set you on fire,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cOn the other hand, \nHaymitch . . . well, if I were you, I\u2019d avoid Haymitch complete-\nly. He hates you.\u201d \n\n\u201cI thought you said I was his favorite,\u201d I say. \n\u201cHe hates me more,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in \n\ngeneral are his sort of thing.\u201d \nI know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Hay-\n\nmitch\u2019s expense. He has been around so long, he\u2019s practically \nan old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the \nstage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, \nthey\u2019ll have dragged him out of the control room for inter-\nviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he\u2019s made up. He\u2019s \nat something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a \npartner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to \nbe ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me \nwhen I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he\u2019s holding up, \nwith the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to \nkeep us alive. \n\nIt\u2019s funny. Haymitch and I don\u2019t get along well in person, \nbut maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he \nseems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. \nLike how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it \nand how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn\u2019t something to ease \nPeeta\u2019s pain and how I know now that I have to play up the \nromance. He hasn\u2019t made much effort to connect with Peeta \n\n\n\n \n\n302 \n \n\nreally. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl \nof broth to Peeta, whereas I\u2019ll see the strings attached to it. \n\nA thought hits me, and I\u2019m amazed the question\u2019s taken so \nlong to surface. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve only recently begun to \nview Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. \u201cHow do you think \nhe did it?\u201d \n\n\u201cWho? Did what?\u201d Peeta asks. \n\u201cHaymitch. How do you think he won the Games?\u201d I say. \nPeeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Hay-\n\nmitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or \nThresh. He\u2019s not particularly handsome. Not in the way that \ncauses sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he\u2019s so surly, it\u2019s \nhard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There\u2019s only \none way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as \nI\u2019m reaching this conclusion myself. \n\n\u201cHe outsmarted the others,\u201d says Peeta. \nI nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I\u2019m won-\n\ndering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and \nme because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. \nMaybe he wasn\u2019t always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he \ntried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must \nbe hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after \nyear after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will be-\ncome my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is \nso repellent, I thrust it from my mind. \n\nAbout half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat \nagain. Peeta\u2019s too hungry himself to put up an argument. \nWhile I\u2019m dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew \n\n\n\n \n\n303 \n \n\nand rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his \neyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky. \n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be anything to see tonight,\u201d I say, far more in-\nterested in the stew than the sky. \u201cNothing\u2019s happened or we \nwould\u2019ve heard a cannon.\u201d \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d Peeta says quietly. \n\u201cWhat? Should we split another roll, too?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cKatniss,\u201d he repeats, but I find myself wanting to ignore \n\nhim. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to split one. But I\u2019ll save the cheese for tomor-\n\nrow,\u201d I say. I see Peeta staring at me. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cThresh is dead,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cHe can\u2019t be,\u201d I say. \n\u201cThey must have fired the cannon during the thunder and \n\nwe missed it,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cAre you sure? I mean, it\u2019s pouring buckets out there. I \n\ndon\u2019t know how you can see anything,\u201d I say. I push him away \nfrom the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For \nabout ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh\u2019s pic-\nture and then he\u2019s gone. Just like that. \n\nI slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting \nabout the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? \nOne less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But I\u2019m not \nhappy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me \nrun because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach. . \n. . \n\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d asks Peeta. \n\n\n\n \n\n304 \n \n\nI give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my \nhands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real \npain because who\u2019s going to bet on a tribute who keeps snive-\nling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We \nwere allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my \nsorrow at Thresh\u2019s murder. The word pulls me up short. Mur-\nder! Thankfully, I didn\u2019t say it aloud. That\u2019s not going to win \nme any points in the arena. What I do say is, \u201cIt\u2019s just . . . if we \ndidn\u2019t win . . . I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And \nbecause of Rue.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cBut this means we\u2019re one step \ncloser to District Twelve.\u201d He nudges a plate of foot into my \nhands. \u201cEat. It\u2019s still warm.\u201d \n\nI take a bite of the stew to show I don\u2019t really care, but it\u2019s \nlike glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. \u201cIt \nalso means Cato will be back hunting us.\u201d \n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019s got supplies again,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll be wounded, I bet,\u201d I say. \n\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d Peeta asks. \n\u201cBecause Thresh would have never gone down without a \n\nfight. He\u2019s so strong, I mean, he was. And they were in his ter-\nritory,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cGood,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cThe more wounded Cato is the better. I \nwonder how Foxface is making out.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s fine,\u201d I say peevishly. I\u2019m still angry she thought \nof hiding in the Cornucopia and I didn\u2019t. \u201cProbably be easier to \ncatch Cato than her.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n305 \n \n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll catch each other and we can just go home,\u201d \nsays Peeta. \u201cBut we better be extra careful about the watches. \nI dozed off a few times.\u201d \n\n\u201cMe, too,\u201d I admit. \u201cBut not tonight.\u201d \nWe finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take \n\nthe first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, \npulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. I \njust need a few moments of privacy where I can let any emo-\ntion cross my face without being seen. Under the hood, I si-\nlently say good-bye to Thresh and thank him for my life. I \npromise to remember him and, if I can, do something to help \nhis family and Rue\u2019s, if I win. Then I escape into sleep, com-\nforted by a full belly and the steady warmth of Peeta beside \nme. \n\nWhen Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the \nsmell of goat cheese. He\u2019s holding out half a roll spread with \nthe creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. \u201cDon\u2019t be \nmad,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to eat again. Here\u2019s your half.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, good,\u201d I say, immediately taking a huge bite. The \nstrong fatty cheese tastes just like the kind Prim makes, the \napples are sweet and crunchy. \u201cMm.\u201d \n\n\u201cWe make a goat cheese and apple tart at the bakery,\u201d he \nsays. \n\n\u201cBet that\u2019s expensive,\u201d I say. \n\u201cToo expensive for my family to eat. Unless it\u2019s gone very \n\nstale. Of course, practically everything we eat is stale,\u201d says \nPeeta, pulling the sleeping bag up around him. In less than a \nminute, he\u2019s snoring. \n\n\n\n \n\n306 \n \n\nHuh. I always assumed the shopkeepers live a soft life. \nAnd it\u2019s true, Peeta has always had enough to eat. But \n\nthere\u2019s something kind of depressing about living your life on \nstale bread, the hard, dry loaves that no one else wanted. One \nthing about us, since I bring our food home on a daily basis, \nmost of it is so fresh you have to make sure it isn\u2019t going to \nmake a run for it. \n\nSomewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually \nbut all at once. The downpour ends and there\u2019s only the resi-\ndual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now \noverflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, \nand even without the glasses I can see outside. I can\u2019t decide if \nthe moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I \nknow it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched \nit rise as we hunted into the late hours. \n\nHow long have I been gone? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s been about \ntwo weeks in the arena, and there was that week of prepara-\ntion in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. \nFor some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one \nI see from the woods around District 12. That would give me \nsomething to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where \nthe authenticity of everything is to be doubted. \n\nFour of us left. \nFor the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the \n\npossibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To \nmy own house in the Victor\u2019s Village. My mother and Prim \nwould live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind \nof freedom. But then . . . what? What would my life be like on a \n\n\n\n \n\n307 \n \n\ndaily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition \nof food. Take that away and I\u2019m not really sure who I am, what \nmy identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, \nwith all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, \nno wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I don\u2019t \nwant to end up like that. \n\n\u201cBut you won\u2019t be alone,\u201d I whisper to myself. I have my \nmother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then . . . I don\u2019t \nwant to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my moth-\ner passed away. I know I\u2019ll never marry, never risk bringing a \nchild into the world. Because if there\u2019s one thing being a victor \ndoesn\u2019t guarantee, it\u2019s your children\u2019s safety. My kids\u2019 names \nwould go right into the reaping balls with everyone else\u2019s. And \nI swear I\u2019ll never let that happen. \n\nThe sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the \ncracks and illuminating Peeta\u2019s face. Who will he transform in-\nto if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who \ncan spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes \nhim to be hopelessly in love with me, and I\u2019ll admit it, there \nare moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, \n\nwe\u2019ll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that we\u2019ve \nsaved each other\u2019s lives in here. And beyond that, he will al-\nways be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything \nbeyond that though . . . and I feel Gale\u2019s gray eyes watching me \nwatching Peeta, all the way from District 12. \n\nDiscomfort causes me to move. I scoot over and shake Pee-\nta\u2019s shoulder. His eyes open sleepily and when they focus on \nme, he pulls me down for a long kiss. \n\n\n\n \n\n308 \n \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re wasting hunting time,\u201d I say when I finally break \naway. \n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it wasting,\u201d he says giving a big stretch as \nhe sits up. \u201cSo do we hunt on empty stomachs to give us an \nedge?\u201d \n\n\u201cNot us,\u201d I say. \u201cWe stuff ourselves to give us staying pow-\ner.\u201d \n\n\u201cCount me in,\u201d Peeta says. But I can see he\u2019s surprised when \nI divide the rest of the stew and rice and hand a heaping plate \nto him. \u201cAll this?\u201d \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll earn it back today,\u201d I say, and we both plow into our \nplates. Even cold, it\u2019s one of the best things I\u2019ve ever tasted. I \nabandon my fork and scrape up the last dabs of gravy with my \nfinger. \u201cI can feel Effie Trinket shuddering at my manners.\u201d \n\n\u201cHey, Effie, watch this!\u201d says Peeta. He tosses his fork over \nhis shoulder and literally licks his plate clean with his tongue \nmaking loud, satisfied sounds. Then he blows a kiss out to her \nin general and calls, \u201cWe miss you, Effie!\u201d \n\nI cover his mouth with my hand, but I\u2019m laughing. \u201cStop! \nCato could be right outside our cave.\u201d \n\nHe grabs my hand away. \u201cWhat do I care? I\u2019ve got you to \nprotect me now,\u201d says Peeta, pulling me to him. \n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I say in exasperation, extricating myself from \nhis grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. \n\nOnce we\u2019re packed up and standing outside our cave, our \nmood shifts to serious. It\u2019s as though for the last few days, \nsheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato\u2019s preoccupation \nwith Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, \n\n\n\n \n\n309 \n \n\nalthough the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we\u2019re re-\nally back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever \nweapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his \nbelt. My last seven arrows \u2014 of the twelve I sacrificed three in \nthe explosion, two at the feast \u2014 rattle a bit too loosely in the \nquiver. I can\u2019t afford to lose any more. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be hunting us by now,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cCato isn\u2019t one to \nwait for his prey to wander by.\u201d \n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s wounded \u2014\u201d I begin. \n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter,\u201d Peeta breaks in. \u201cIf he can move, he\u2019s \n\ncoming.\u201d \nWith all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by sev-\n\neral feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I \ncheck the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not sur-\nprising with the weather. Besides, I haven\u2019t seen many ani-\nmals or signs of them in this area. \n\n\u201cIf we want food, we better head back up to my old hunting \ngrounds,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cYour call. Just tell me what you need me to do,\u201d Peeta says. \n\u201cKeep an eye out,\u201d I say. \u201cStay on the rocks as much as poss-\n\nible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for \nboth of us.\u201d It\u2019s clear, at this point, that the explosion de-\nstroyed the hearing in my left ear for good. \n\nI\u2019d walk in the water to cover our tracks completely, but I\u2019m \nnot sure Peeta\u2019s leg could take the current. Although the drugs \nhave erased the infection, he\u2019s still pretty weak. My forehead \nhurts along the knife cut, but after three days the bleeding has \n\n\n\n \n\n310 \n \n\nstopped. I wear a bandage around my head though, just in \ncase physical exertion should bring it back. \n\nAs we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place \nwhere I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud. One \ngood thing, between the downpour and the flooded banks, all \nsigns of his hiding place have been wiped out. That means \nthat, if need be, we can come back to our cave. Otherwise, I \nwouldn\u2019t risk it with Cato after us. \n\nThe boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to peb-\nbles, and then, to my relief, we\u2019re back on pine needles and the \ngentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we \nhave a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg \u2014 \nwell, you\u2019re naturally going to make some noise. But even on \nthe smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud. And I mean loud \n\nloud, as if he\u2019s stomping his feet or something. I turn and look \nat him. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to move more quietly,\u201d I say. \u201cForget about Ca-\n\nto, you\u2019re chasing off every rabbit in a ten-mile radius.\u201d \n\u201cReally?\u201d he says. \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d \nSo, we start up again and he\u2019s a tiny bit better, but even \n\nwith only one working ear, he\u2019s making me jump. \n\u201cCan you take your boots off?\u201d I suggest. \n\u201cHere?\u201d he asks in disbelief, as if I\u2019d asked him to walk bare-\n\nfoot on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that \nhe\u2019s still not used to the woods, that it\u2019s the scary, forbidden \nplace beyond the fences of District 12. I think of Gale, with his \nvelvet tread. It\u2019s eerie how little sound he makes, even when \n\n\n\n \n\n311 \n \n\nthe leaves have fallen and it\u2019s a challenge to move at all with-\nout chasing off the game. I feel certain he\u2019s laughing back \nhome. \n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say patiently. \u201cI will, too. That way we\u2019ll both be \nquieter.\u201d Like I was making any noise. So we both strip off our \nboots and socks and, while there\u2019s some improvement, I could \nswear he\u2019s making an effort to snap every branch we encoun-\nter. \n\nNeedless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my \nold camp with Rue, I\u2019ve shot nothing. If the stream would set-\ntle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too \nstrong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a \nsolution. Ideally, I\u2019d dump Peeta now with some simple root-\ngathering chore and go hunt, but then he\u2019d be left with only a \nknife to defend himself against Cato\u2019s spears and superior \nstrength. So what I\u2019d really like is to try and conceal him \nsomewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. \nBut I have a feeling his ego isn\u2019t going to go for that sugges-\ntion. \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to split up. I know I\u2019m chasing \naway the game.\u201d \n\n\u201cOnly because your leg\u2019s hurt,\u201d I say generously, because \nreally, you can tell that\u2019s only a small part of the problem. \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, why don\u2019t you go on? Show me some \nplants to gather and that way we\u2019ll both be useful.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot if Cato comes and kills you.\u201d I tried to say it in a nice \nway, but it still sounds like I think he\u2019s a weakling. \n\n\n\n \n\n312 \n \n\nSurprisingly, he just laughs. \u201cLook, I can handle Cato. I \nfought him before, didn\u2019t I?\u201d \n\nYeah, and that turned out great. You ended up dying in a \nmud bank. That\u2019s what I want to say, but I can\u2019t. He did save \nmy life by taking on Cato after all. I try another tactic. \u201cWhat if \nyou climbed up in a tree and acted as a lookout while I \nhunted?\u201d I say, trying to make it sound like very important \nwork. \n\n\u201cWhat if you show me what\u2019s edible around here and go get \nus some meat?\u201d he says, mimicking my tone. \u201cJust don\u2019t go far, \nin case you need help.\u201d \n\nI sigh and show him some roots to dig. We do need food, no \nquestion. One apple, two rolls, and a blob of cheese the size of \na plum won\u2019t last long. I\u2019ll just go a short distance and hope \nCato is a long way off. \n\nI teach him a bird whistle \u2014 not a melody like Rue\u2019s but a \nsimple two-note whistle \u2014 which we can use to communicate \nthat we\u2019re all right. Fortunately, he\u2019s good at this. Leaving him \nwith the pack, I head off. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m eleven again, tethered not to the safety of the \nfence but to Peeta, allowing myself twenty, maybe thirty yards \nof hunting space. Away from him though, the woods come \nalive with animal sounds. Reassured by his periodic whistles, I \nallow myself to drift farther away, and soon have two rabbits \nand a fat squirrel to show for it. I decide it\u2019s enough. I can set \nsnares and maybe get some fish. With Peeta\u2019s roots, this will \nbe enough for now. \n\n\n\n \n\n313 \n \n\nAs I travel the short distance back, I realize we haven\u2019t ex-\nchanged signals in a while. When my whistle receives no re-\nsponse, I run. In no time, I find the pack, a neat pile of roots \nbeside it. The sheet of plastic has been laid on the ground \nwhere the sun can reach the single layer of berries that covers \nit. But where is he? \n\n\u201cPeeta!\u201d I call out in a panic. \u201cPeeta!\u201d I turn to the rustle of \nbrush and almost send an arrow through him. Fortunately, I \npull my bow at the last second and it sticks in an oak trunk to \nhis left. He jumps back, flinging a handful of berries into the \nfoliage. \n\nMy fear comes out as anger. \u201cWhat are you doing? You\u2019re \nsupposed to be here, not running around in the woods!\u201d \n\n\u201cI found some berries down by the stream,\u201d he says, clearly \nconfused by my outburst. \n\n\u201cI whistled. Why didn\u2019t you whistle back?\u201d I snap at him. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear. The water\u2019s too loud, I guess,\u201d he says. He \n\ncrosses and puts his hands on my shoulders. That\u2019s when I \nfeel that I\u2019m trembling. \n\n\u201cI thought Cato killed you!\u201d I almost shout. \n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Peeta wraps his arms around me, but I don\u2019t \n\nrespond. \u201cKatniss?\u201d \nI push away, trying to sort out my feelings. \u201cIf two people \n\nagree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them \ndoesn\u2019t answer, they\u2019re in trouble, all right?\u201d \n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d he says. \n\u201cAll right. Because that\u2019s what happened with Rue, and I \n\nwatched her die!\u201d I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack \n\n\n\n \n\n314 \n \n\nand open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in \nmine. But I\u2019m not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The \nrolls and apples are untouched, but someone\u2019s definitely \npicked away part of the cheese. \u201cAnd you ate without me!\u201d I \nreally don\u2019t care, I just want something else to be mad about. \n\n\u201cWhat? No, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Peeta says. \n\u201cOh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese,\u201d I say. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know what ate the cheese,\u201d Peeta says slowly and \n\ndistinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t me. \nI\u2019ve been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you \ncare for some?\u201d \n\nI would actually, but I don\u2019t want to relent too soon. I do \nwalk over and look at them. I\u2019ve never seen this type before. \nNo, I have. But not in the arena. These aren\u2019t Rue\u2019s berries, al-\nthough they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned \nabout in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them \nbetween my fingers. \n\nMy father\u2019s voice comes back to me. \u201cNot these, Katniss. \nNever these. They\u2019re nightlock. You\u2019ll be dead before they \nreach your stomach.\u201d \n\nJust then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta \nto collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The \nhovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What\u2019s left of \nFoxface\u2019s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red \nglint of her hair in the sunlight. \n\nI should have known the moment I saw the missing cheese. \n. . . \n\n\n\n \n\n315 \n \n\nPeeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. \u201cClimb. \nHe\u2019ll be here in a second. We\u2019ll stand a better chance fighting \nhim from above.\u201d \n\nI stop him, suddenly calm. \u201cNo, Peeta, she\u2019s your kill, not \nCato\u2019s.\u201d \n\n\u201cWhat? I haven\u2019t even seen her since the first day,\u201d he says. \n\u201cHow could I have killed her?\u201d \n\nIn answer, I hold out the berries. \n\n\n\n \n\n316 \n \n\n \n \n \nIt takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How Fox-\n\nface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, \nhow she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that \nanyone would notice it, how she wouldn\u2019t question the safety \nof berries we were preparing to eat ourselves. \n\n\u201cI wonder how she found us,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cMy fault, I guess, \nif I\u2019m as loud as you say.\u201d \n\nWe were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I try \nto be kind. \u201cAnd she\u2019s very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until \nyou outfoxed her.\u201d \n\n\u201cNot on purpose. Doesn\u2019t seem fair somehow. I mean, we \nwould have both been dead, too, if she hadn\u2019t eaten the ber-\nries first.\u201d He checks himself. \u201cNo, of course, we wouldn\u2019t. You \nrecognized them, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \n\nI give a nod. \u201cWe call them nightlock.\u201d \n\u201cEven the name sounds deadly,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katniss. \n\nI really thought they were the same ones you\u2019d gathered.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize. It just means we\u2019re one step closer to \n\nhome, right?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cI\u2019ll get rid of the rest,\u201d Peeta says. He gathers up the sheet \n\nof blue plastic, careful to trap the berries inside, and goes to \ntoss them into the woods. \n\n\n\n \n\n317 \n \n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I cry. I find the leather pouch that belonged to the \nboy from District 1 and fill it with a few handfuls of berries \nfrom the plastic. \u201cIf they fooled Foxface, maybe they can fool \nCato as well. If he\u2019s chasing us or something, we can act like \nwe accidentally drop the pouch and if he eats them \u2014\u201d \n\n\u201cThen hello District Twelve,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I say, securing the pouch to my belt. \n\u201cHe\u2019ll know where we are now,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cIf he was any-\n\nwhere nearby and saw that hovercraft, he\u2019ll know we killed \nher and come after us.\u201d \n\nPeeta\u2019s right. This could be just the opportunity Cato\u2019s been \nwaiting for. But even if we run now, there\u2019s the meat to cook \nand our fire will be another sign of our whereabouts. \u201cLet\u2019s \nmake a fire. Right now.\u201d I begin to gather branches and brush. \n\n\u201cAre you ready to face him?\u201d Peeta asks. \n\u201cI\u2019m ready to eat. Better to cook our food while we have the \n\nchance. If he knows we\u2019re here, he knows. But he also knows \nthere\u2019s two of us and probably assumes we were hunting Fox-\nface. That means you\u2019re recovered. And the fire means we\u2019re \nnot hiding, we\u2019re inviting him here. Would you show up?\u201d I \nask. \n\n\u201cMaybe not,\u201d he says. \nPeeta\u2019s a whiz with fires, coaxing a blaze out of the damp \n\nwood. In no time, I have the rabbits and squirrel roasting, the \nroots, wrapped in leaves, baking in the coals. We take turns \ngathering greens and keeping a careful watch for Cato, but as I \nanticipated, he doesn\u2019t make an appearance. \n\n\n\n \n\n318 \n \n\nWhen the food\u2019s cooked, I pack most of it up, leaving us \neach a rabbit\u2019s leg to eat as we walk. \n\nI want to move higher into the woods, climb a good tree, \nand make camp for the night, but Peeta resists. \u201cI can\u2019t climb \nlike you, Katniss, especially with my leg, and I don\u2019t think I \ncould ever fall asleep fifty feet above the ground.\u201d \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe to stay in the open, Peeta,\u201d I say. \n\u201cCan\u2019t we go back to the cave?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s near water and \n\neasy to defend.\u201d \nI sigh. Several more hours of walking \u2014 or should I say \n\ncrashing \u2014 through the woods to reach an area we\u2019ll just have \nto leave in the morning to hunt. But Peeta doesn\u2019t ask for \nmuch. He\u2019s followed my instructions all day and I\u2019m sure if \nthings were reversed, he wouldn\u2019t make me spend the night in \na tree. It dawns on me that I haven\u2019t been very nice to Peeta \ntoday. Nagging him about how loud he was, screaming at him \nover disappearing. The playful romance we had sustained in \nthe cave has disappeared out in the open, under the hot sun, \nwith the threat of Cato looming over us. Haymitch has proba-\nbly just about had it with me. And as for the audience . . . \n\nI reach up and give him a kiss. \u201cSure. Let\u2019s go back to the \ncave.\u201d \n\nHe looks pleased and relieved. \u201cWell, that was easy.\u201d \nI work my arrow out of the oak, careful not to damage the \n\nshaft. These arrows are food, safety, and life itself now. \nWe toss a bunch more wood on the fire. It should be send-\n\ning off smoke for a few more hours, although I doubt Cato as-\nsumes anything at this point. When we reach the stream, I see \n\n\n\n \n\n319 \n \n\nthe water has dropped considerably and moves at its old lei-\nsurely pace, so I suggest we walk back in it. Peeta\u2019s happy to \noblige and since he\u2019s a lot quieter in water than on land, it\u2019s a \ndoubly good idea. It\u2019s a long walk back to the cave though, \neven going downward, even with the rabbit to give us a boost. \nWe\u2019re both exhausted by our hike today and still way too un-\nderfed. I keep my bow loaded, both for Cato and any fish I \nmight see, but the stream seems strangely empty of creatures. \n\nBy the time we reach our destination, our feet are dragging \nand the sun sits low on the horizon. We fill up our water bot-\ntles and climb the little slope to our den. It\u2019s not much, but out \nhere in the wilderness, it\u2019s the closest thing we have to a \nhome. It will be warmer than a tree, too, because it provides \nsome shelter from the wind that has begun to blow steadily in \nfrom the west. I set a good dinner out, but halfway through \nPeeta begins to nod off. After days of inactivity, the hunt has \ntaken its toll. I order him into the sleeping bag and set aside \nthe rest of his food for when he wakes. He drops off imme-\ndiately. I pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his fore-\nhead, not for the audience, but for me. Because I\u2019m so grateful \nthat he\u2019s still here, not dead by the stream as I\u2019d thought. So \nglad that I don\u2019t have to face Cato alone. \n\nBrutal, bloody Cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his \narm, who had the power to overcome Thresh, who has had it \nout for me since the beginning. He probably has had a special \nhatred for me ever since I outscored him in training. A boy \nlike Peeta would simply shrug that off. But I have a feeling it \ndrove Cato to distraction. Which is not that hard. I think of his \n\n\n\n \n\n320 \n \n\nridiculous reaction to finding the supplies blown up. The oth-\ners were upset, of course, but he was completely unhinged. I \nwonder now if Cato might not be entirely sane. \n\nThe sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface shine in \nthe sky and then disappear from the world forever. He hasn\u2019t \nsaid it, but I don\u2019t think Peeta felt good about killing her, even \nif it was essential. I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019ll miss her, but I have to \nadmire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, \nshe would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, \nwe had been setting a trap for her, I bet she\u2019d have sensed it \nand avoided the berries. It was Peeta\u2019s own ignorance that \nbrought her down. I\u2019ve spent so much time making sure I \ndon\u2019t underestimate my opponents that I\u2019ve forgotten it\u2019s just \nas dangerous to overestimate them as well. \n\nThat brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a sense \nof Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he\u2019s a little \nmore slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don\u2019t \nknow. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Fox-\nface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judg-\nment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that \npoint. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the \napple in the pig\u2019s mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do \nunderstand Cato better than I think. \n\nDespite the fatigue in my body, my mind\u2019s alert, so I let Pee-\nta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft gray day has \nbegun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in \nalarm. \u201cI slept the whole night. That\u2019s not fair, Katniss, you \nshould have woken me.\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n321 \n \n\nI stretch and burrow down into the bag. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep now. \nWake me if anything interesting happens.\u201d \n\nApparently nothing does, because when I open my eyes, \nbright hot afternoon light gleams through the rocks. \u201cAny sign \nof our friend?\u201d I ask. \n\nPeeta shakes his head. \u201cNo, he\u2019s keeping a disturbingly low \nprofile.\u201d \n\n\u201cHow long do you think we\u2019ll have before the Gamemakers \ndrive us together?\u201d I ask. \n\n\u201cWell, Foxface died almost a day ago, so there\u2019s been plenty \nof time for the audience to place bets and get bored. I guess it \ncould happen at any moment,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cYeah, I have a feeling today\u2019s the day,\u201d I say. I sit up and \nlook out at the peaceful terrain. \u201cI wonder how they\u2019ll do it.\u201d \n\nPeeta remains silent. There\u2019s not really any good answer. \n\u201cWell, until they do, no sense in wasting a hunting day. But \n\nwe should probably eat as much as we can hold just in case we \nrun into trouble,\u201d I say. \n\nPeeta packs up our gear while I lay out a big meal. The rest \nof the rabbits, roots, greens, the rolls spread with the last bit \nof cheese. The only thing I leave in reserve is the squirrel and \nthe apple. \n\nBy the time we\u2019re done, all that\u2019s left is a pile of rabbit \nbones. My hands are greasy, which only adds to my growing \nfeeling of grubbiness. Maybe we don\u2019t bathe daily in the Seam, \nbut we keep cleaner than I have of late. Except for my feet, \nwhich have walked in the stream, I\u2019m covered in a layer of \ngrime. \n\n\n\n \n\n322 \n \n\nLeaving the cave has a sense of finality about it. I don\u2019t \nthink there will be another night in the arena somehow. One \nway or the other, dead or alive, I have the feeling I\u2019ll escape it \ntoday. I give the rocks a pat good-bye and we head down to \nthe stream to wash up. I can feel my skin, itching for the cool \nwater. I may do my hair and braid it back wet. I\u2019m wondering \nif we might even be able to give our clothes a quick scrub \nwhen we reach the stream. Or what used to be the stream. \nNow there\u2019s only a bone-dry bed. I put my hand down to feel \nit. \n\n\u201cNot even a little damp. They must have drained it while we \nslept,\u201d I say. A fear of the cracked tongue, aching body and \nfuzzy mind brought on by my previous dehydration creeps in-\nto my consciousness. Our bottles and skin are fairly full, but \nwith two drinking and this hot sun it won\u2019t take long to dep-\nlete them. \n\n\u201cThe lake,\u201d says Peeta. \u201cThat\u2019s where they want us to go.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe the ponds still have some,\u201d I say hopefully. \n\u201cWe can check,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s just humoring me. I\u2019m \n\nhumoring myself because I know what I\u2019ll find when we re-\nturn to the pond where I soaked my leg. A dusty, gaping \nmouth of a hole. But we make the trip anyway just to confirm \nwhat we already know. \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right. They\u2019re driving us to the lake,\u201d I say. Where \nthere\u2019s no cover. Where they\u2019re guaranteed a bloody fight to \nthe death with nothing to block their view. \u201cDo you want to go \nstraightaway or wait until the water\u2019s tapped out?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n323 \n \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go now, while we\u2019ve had food and rest. Let\u2019s just go \nend this thing,\u201d he says. \n\nI nod. It\u2019s funny. I feel almost as if it\u2019s the first day of the \nGames again. That I\u2019m in the same position. Twenty-one tri-\nbutes are dead, but I still have yet to kill Cato. And really, \nwasn\u2019t he always the one to kill? Now it seems the other tri-\nbutes were just minor obstacles, distractions, keeping us from \nthe real battle of the Games. Cato and me. \n\nBut no, there\u2019s the boy waiting beside me. I feel his arms \nwrap around me. \n\n\u201cTwo against one. Should be a piece of cake,\u201d he says. \n\u201cNext time we eat, it will be in the Capitol,\u201d I answer. \n\u201cYou bet it will,\u201d he says. \nWe stand there a while, locked in an embrace, feeling each \n\nother, the sunlight, the rustle of the leaves at our feet. Then \nwithout a word, we break apart and head for the lake. \n\nI don\u2019t care now that Peeta\u2019s footfalls send rodents scurry-\ning, make birds take wing. We have to fight Cato and I\u2019d just as \nsoon do it here as on the plain. But I doubt I\u2019ll have that \nchoice. If the Gamemakers want us in the open, then in the \nopen we will be. \n\nWe stop to rest for a few moments under the tree where \nthe Careers trapped me. The husk of the tracker jacker nest, \nbeaten to a pulp by the heavy rains and dried in the burning \nsun, confirms the location. I touch it with the tip of my boot, \nand it dissolves into dust that is quickly carried off by the \nbreeze. I can\u2019t help looking up in the tree where Rue secretly \n\n\n\n \n\n324 \n \n\nperched, waiting to save my life. Tracker jackers. Glimmer\u2019s \nbloated body. The terrifying hallucinations . . . \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move on,\u201d I say, wanting to escape the darkness that \nsurrounds this place. Peeta doesn\u2019t object. \n\nGiven our late start to the day, when we reach the plain it\u2019s \nalready early evening. There\u2019s no sign of Cato. No sign of any-\nthing except the gold Cornucopia glowing in the slanting sun \nrays. Just in case Cato decided to pull a Foxface on us, we cir-\ncle the Cornucopia to make sure it\u2019s empty. Then obediently, \nas if following instructions, we cross to the lake and fill our \nwater containers. \n\nI frown at the shrinking sun. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight him af-\nter dark. There\u2019s only the one pair of glasses.\u201d \n\nPeeta carefully squeezes drops of iodine into the water. \n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s what he\u2019s waiting for. What do you want to do? \nGo back to the cave?\u201d \n\n\u201cEither that or find a tree. But let\u2019s give him another half an \nhour or so. Then we\u2019ll take cover,\u201d I answer. \n\nWe sit by the lake, in full sight. There\u2019s no point in hiding \nnow. In the trees at the edge of the plain, I can see the mock-\ningjays flitting about. Bouncing melodies back and forth be-\ntween them like brightly colored balls. I open my mouth and \nsing out Rue\u2019s four-note run. I can feel them pause curiously at \nthe sound of my voice, listening for more. I repeat the notes in \nthe silence. First one mockingjay trills the tune back, then \nanother. Then the whole world comes alive with the sound. \n\n\u201cJust like your father,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\n\n \n\n325 \n \n\nMy fingers find the pin on my shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s Rue\u2019s song,\u201d I \nsay. \u201cI think they remember it.\u201d \n\nThe music swells and I recognize the brilliance of it. As the \nnotes overlap, they compliment one another, forming a lovely, \nunearthly harmony. It was this sound then, thanks to Rue, that \nsent the orchard workers of District 11 home each night. Does \nsomeone start it at quitting time, I wonder, now that she is \ndead? \n\nFor a while, I just close my eyes and listen, mesmerized by \nthe beauty of the song. Then something begins to disrupt the \nmusic. Runs cut off in jagged, imperfect lines. Dissonant notes \nintersperse with the melody. The mockingjays\u2019 voices rise up \nin a shrieking cry of alarm. \n\nWe\u2019re on our feet, Peeta wielding his knife, me poised to \nshoot, when Cato smashes through the trees and bears down \non us. He has no spear. In fact, his hands are empty, yet he \nruns straight for us. My first arrow hits his chest and inexplic-\nably falls aside. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some kind of body armor!\u201d I shout to Peeta. \nJust in time, too, because Cato is upon us. I brace myself, \n\nbut he rockets right between us with no attempt to check his \nspeed. I can tell from his panting, the sweat pouring off his \npurplish face, that he\u2019s been running hard a long time. Not to-\nward us. From something. But what? \n\nMy eyes scan the woods just in time to see the first creature \nleap onto the plain. As I\u2019m turning away, I see another half \ndozen join it. Then I am stumbling blindly after Cato with no \nthought of anything but to save myself.  \n\n\n\n \n\n326 \n \n\n \n \n \nMuttations. No question about it. I\u2019ve never seen these \n\nmutts, but they\u2019re no natural-born animals. They resemble \nhuge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on \nits hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward \nwith its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things I can \nsee at a distance. Up close, I\u2019m sure their more menacing \nattributes will be revealed. \n\nCato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without \nquestion I follow him. If he thinks it\u2019s the safest place, who am \nI to argue? Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it \nwould be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg \u2014 \nPeeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed \ntail of the Cornucopia when I remember I\u2019m part of a team. \nHe\u2019s about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, \nbut the mutts are closing in on him fast. I send an arrow into \nthe pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its \nplace. \n\nPeeta\u2019s waving me up the horn, \u201cGo, Katniss! Go!\u201d \nHe\u2019s right. I can\u2019t protect either of us on the ground. I start \n\nclimbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The \npure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven \nhorn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams \n\n\n\n \n\n327 \n \n\nto get a decent hold on. But after a day in the arena sun, the \nmetal feels hot enough to blister my hands. \n\nCato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet \nabove the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over \nthe edge. Now\u2019s my chance to finish him off. I stop midway up \nthe horn and load another arrow, but just as I\u2019m about to let it \nfly, I hear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he\u2019s just \nreached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels. \n\n\u201cClimb!\u201d I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg \nbut the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow down the throat of \nthe first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the \ncreature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of \nits companions. That\u2019s when I get a look at the claws. Four \ninches and clearly razor-sharp. \n\nPeeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him \nalong. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip \naround, but he\u2019s doubled over with cramps and apparently \nmore preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out \nsomething unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound com-\ning from the mutts isn\u2019t helping. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I shout at him. \n\u201cHe said, \u2018Can they climb it?\u2019\u201d answers Peeta, drawing my \n\nfocus back to the base of the horn. \nThe mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together, \n\nthey raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving \nthem an eerily human quality. Each has a thick coat, some \nwith fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors \nvary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. \n\n\n\n \n\n328 \n \n\nThere\u2019s something else about them, something that makes the \nhair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can\u2019t put my finger \non it. \n\nThey put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the \nmetal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-\npitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they \ncommunicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. \nThen one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond \nfur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs \nmust be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet \nbelow us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it \nhangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled \nme about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are un-\nlike any dog or wolf, any canine I\u2019ve ever seen. They are un-\nmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered \nwhen I notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels \nand the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the \ngreen eyes, the number . . . it\u2019s Glimmer. \n\nA shriek escapes my lips and I\u2019m having trouble holding the \narrow in place. I have been waiting to fire, only too aware of \nmy dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures \ncan, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to \nslide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, \neven though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like \nnails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. Its body twitches \nand flops onto the ground with a thud. \n\n\u201cKatniss?\u201d I can feel Peeta\u2019s grip on my arm. \n\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201d I get out. \n\n\n\n \n\n329 \n \n\n\u201cWho?\u201d asks Peeta. \nMy head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, tak-\n\ning in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red \ncoat and amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and \nhazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled \nfor the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with \ndark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in \nwoven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue . . . \n\n\u201cWhat is it, Katniss?\u201d Peeta shakes my shoulder. \n\u201cIt\u2019s them. It\u2019s all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface and . \n\n. . all of the other tributes,\u201d I choke out. \nI hear Peeta\u2019s gasp of recognition. \u201cWhat did they do to \n\nthem? You don\u2019t think . . . those could be their real eyes?\u201d \nTheir eyes are the least of my worries. What about their \n\nbrains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memo-\nries? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particu-\nlarly because we have survived and they were so callously \nmurdered? And the ones we actually killed . . . do they believe \nthey\u2019re avenging their own deaths? \n\nBefore I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault on \nthe horn. They\u2019ve split into two groups at the sides of the horn \nand are using those powerful hindquarters to launch them-\nselves at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my \nhand and then I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, \nthe heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side. If \nnot for the grip on my arm, he\u2019d be on the ground, but as it is, \nit takes all my strength to keep us both on the curved back of \nthe horn. And more tributes are coming. \n\n\n\n \n\n330 \n \n\n\u201cKill it, Peeta! Kill it!\u201d I\u2019m shouting, and although I can\u2019t \nquite see what\u2019s happening, I know he must have stabbed the \nthing because the pull lessens. I\u2019m able to haul him back onto \nthe horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the \nlesser of two evils awaits. \n\nCato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is \nslowing and I know soon he\u2019ll be recovered enough to come \nfor us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. I arm my bow, \nbut the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be \nThresh. Who else could jump so high? I feel a moment\u2019s relief \nbecause we must finally be up above the mutt line and I\u2019m just \nturning back to face Cato when Peeta\u2019s jerked from my side. \nI\u2019m sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. \n\nCato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding \nPeeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peeta\u2019s \nclawing at Cato\u2019s arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether \nit\u2019s more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of \nblood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf. \n\nI aim one of my last two arrows at Cato\u2019s head, knowing it\u2019ll \nhave no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are \nclothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh. Some high-grade \nbody armor from the Capitol. Was that what was in his pack at \nthe feast? Body armor to defend against my arrows? Well, \nthey neglected to send a face guard. \n\nCato just laughs. \u201cShoot me and he goes down with me.\u201d \nHe\u2019s right. If I take him out and he falls to the mutts, Peeta \n\nis sure to die with him. We\u2019ve reached a stalemate. I can\u2019t \nshoot Cato without killing Peeta, too. He can\u2019t kill Peeta with-\n\n\n\n \n\n331 \n \n\nout guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues, \nboth of us seeking an out. \n\nMy muscles are strained so tightly, they feel they might \nsnap at any moment. My teeth clenched to the breaking point. \nThe mutts go silent and the only thing I can hear is the blood \npounding in my good ear. \n\nPeeta\u2019s lips are turning blue. If I don\u2019t do something quick-\nly, he\u2019ll die of asphyxiation and then I\u2019ll have lost him and Cato \nwill probably use his body as a weapon against me. In fact, I\u2019m \nsure this is Cato\u2019s plan because while he\u2019s stopped laughing, \nhis lips are set in a triumphant smile. \n\nAs if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping \nwith blood from his leg, up to Cato\u2019s arm. Instead of trying to \nwrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deli-\nberate X on the back of Cato\u2019s hand. Cato realizes what it \nmeans exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the \nsmile drops from his lips. But it\u2019s one second too late because, \nby that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and \nreflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a \nhorrible moment, I think they\u2019re both going over. I dive for-\nward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on \nthe blood-slick horn and plummets to the ground. \n\nWe hear him hit, the air leaving his body on impact, and \nthen the mutts attack him. Peeta and I hold on to each other, \nwaiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, \nwaiting to be released. But it doesn\u2019t happen. Not yet. Because \nthis is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience ex-\npects a show. \n\n\n\n \n\n332 \n \n\nI don\u2019t watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the \nhowls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the \nmutt pack. I can\u2019t understand how he can be surviving until I \nremember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck \nand I realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a \nknife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in \nhis clothes, because on occasion there\u2019s the death scream of a \nmutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with \nthe golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the \nCornucopia, and I know Cato must be attempting the one ma-\nneuver that could save his life \u2014 to make his way back around \nto the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his \nremarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered. \n\nI don\u2019t know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, \nwhen Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging \nhim, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now they\u2019ll finish \n\nhim off, I think. But there\u2019s still no cannon. \nNight falls and the anthem plays and there\u2019s no picture of \n\nCato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the met-\nal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me \nthat the Games are not over and may not be for who knows \nhow long, and there is still no guarantee of victory. \n\nI turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding \nas badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by \nthe lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the \nmutts. I have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood \nfrom his calf. Although I\u2019m shaking in the biting wind, I rip off \nmy jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as \n\n\n\n \n\n333 \n \n\nswiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chatter-\ning beyond control. \n\nPeeta\u2019s face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie \ndown before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs \nover my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. I\u2019ve seen my \nmother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate \nit. I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his \nleg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. I don\u2019t have a stick, \nso I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twist-\ning it as tightly as I dare. It\u2019s risky business \u2014 Peeta may end \nup losing his leg \u2014 but when I weigh this against him losing \nhis life, what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in \nthe rest of my shirt and lay down with him. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep,\u201d I tell him. I\u2019m not sure if this is exactly \nmedical protocol, but I\u2019m terrified that if he drifts off he\u2019ll \nnever wake again. \n\n\u201cAre you cold?\u201d he asks. He unzips his jacket and I press \nagainst him as he fastens it around me. It\u2019s a bit warmer, shar-\ning our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the \nnight is young. The temperature will continue to drop. \n\nEven now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when \nI first climbed it, slowly turning to ice. \n\n\u201cCato may win this thing yet,\u201d I whisper to Peeta. \n\u201cDon\u2019t you believe it,\u201d he says, pulling up my hood, but he\u2019s \n\nshaking harder than I am. \nThe next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think \n\nabout it, is saying something. The cold would be torture \nenough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning, \n\n\n\n \n\n334 \n \n\nbegging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away \nat him. After a very short time, I don\u2019t care who he is or what \nhe\u2019s done, all I want is for his suffering to end. \n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just kill him?\u201d I ask Peeta. \n\u201cYou know why,\u201d he says, and pulls me closer to him. \nAnd I do. No viewer could turn away from the show now. \n\nFrom the Gamemakers\u2019 point of view, this is the final word in \nentertainment. \n\nIt goes on and on and on and eventually completely con-\nsumes my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomor-\nrow, erasing everything but the present, which I begin to be-\nlieve will never change. There will never be anything but cold \nand fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn. \n\nPeeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I find \nmyself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes \nand dies on me now, I know I\u2019ll go completely insane. He\u2019s \nfighting it, probably more for me than for him, and it\u2019s hard \nbecause unconsciousness would be its own form of escape. \nBut the adrenaline pumping through my body would never al-\nlow me to follow him, so I can\u2019t let him go. I just can\u2019t. \n\nThe only indication of the passage of time lies in the hea-\nvens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it \nout to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes, \nfor just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of \nthe night engulfs me again. \n\nFinally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my \neyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can \nsee, too, how bloodless Peeta\u2019s face has become. How little \n\n\n\n \n\n335 \n \n\ntime he has left. And I know I have to get him back to the Capi-\ntol. \n\nStill, no cannon has fired. I press my good ear against the \nhorn and can just make out Cato\u2019s voice. \n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s closer now. Katniss, can you shoot him?\u201d Peeta \nasks. \n\nIf he\u2019s near the mouth, I may be able to take him out. It \nwould be an act of mercy at this point. \n\n\u201cMy last arrow\u2019s in your tourniquet,\u201d I say. \n\u201cMake it count,\u201d says Peeta, unzipping his jacket, letting me \n\nloose. \nSo I free the arrow, tying the tourniquet back as tightly as \n\nmy frozen fingers can manage. I rub my hands together, trying \nto regain circulation. When I crawl to the lip of the horn and \nhang over the edge, I feel Peeta\u2019s hands grip me for support. \n\nIt takes a few moments to find Cato in the dim light, in the \nblood. Then the raw hunk of meat that used to be my enemy \nmakes a sound, and I know where his mouth is. And I think \nthe word he\u2019s trying to say is please. \n\nPity, not vengeance, sends my arrow flying into his skull. \nPeeta pulls me back up, bow in hand, quiver empty. \n\n\u201cDid you get him?\u201d he whispers. \nThe cannon fires in answer. \n\u201cThen we won, Katniss,\u201d he says hollowly. \n\u201cHurray for us,\u201d I get out, but there\u2019s no joy of victory in my \n\nvoice. \n\n\n\n \n\n336 \n \n\nA hole opens in the plain and as if on cue, the remaining \nmutts bound into it, disappearing as the earth closes above \nthem. \n\nWe wait, for the hovercraft to take Cato\u2019s remains, for the \ntrumpets of victory that should follow, but nothing happens. \n\n\u201cHey!\u201d I shout into air. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d The only re-\nsponse is the chatter of waking birds. \n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the body. Maybe we have to move away from \nit,\u201d says Peeta. \n\nI try to remember. Do you have to distance yourself from \nthe dead tribute on the final kill? My brain is too muddled to \nbe sure, but what else could be the reason for the delay? \n\n\u201cOkay. Think you could make it to the lake?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cThink I better try,\u201d says Peeta. We inch down to the tail of \n\nthe horn and fall to the ground. If the stiffness in my limbs is \nthis bad, how can Peeta even move? I rise first, swinging and \nbending my arms and legs until I think I can help him up. \nSomehow, we make it back to the lake. I scoop up a handful of \nthe cold water for Peeta and bring a second to my lips. \n\nA mockingjay gives the long, low whistle, and tears of relief \nfill my eyes as the hovercraft appears and takes Cato\u2019s body \naway. Now they will take us. Now we can go home. \n\nBut again there\u2019s no response. \n\u201cWhat are they waiting for?\u201d says Peeta weakly. Between \n\nthe loss of the tourniquet and the effort it took to get to the \nlake, his wound has opened up again. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say. Whatever the holdup is, I can\u2019t watch \nhim lose any more blood. I get up to find a stick but almost \n\n\n\n \n\n337 \n \n\nimmediately come across the arrow that bounced off Cato\u2019s \nbody armor. It will do as well as the other arrow. As I stoop to \npick it up, Claudius Templesmith\u2019s voice booms into the arena. \n\n\u201cGreetings to the final contestants of the Seventy-fourth \nHunger Games. The earlier revision has been revoked. Closer \nexamination of the rule book has disclosed that only one win-\nner may be allowed,\u201d he says. \u201cGood luck and may the odds be \never in your favor.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a small burst of static and then nothing more. I \nstare at Peeta in disbelief as the truth sinks in. They never in-\ntended to let us both live. This has all been devised by the Ga-\nmemakers to guarantee the most dramatic showdown in his-\ntory. And like a fool, I bought into it. \n\n\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s not that surprising,\u201d he says softly. \nI watch as he painfully makes it to his feet. Then he\u2019s moving \ntoward me, as if in slow motion, his hand is pulling the knife \nfrom his belt \u2014 \n\nBefore I am even aware of my actions, my bow is loaded \nwith the arrow pointed straight at his heart. Peeta raises his \neyebrows and I see the knife has already left his hand on its \nway to the lake where it splashes in the water. I drop my wea-\npons and take a step back, my face burning in what can only \nbe shame. \n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cDo it.\u201d Peeta limps toward me and thrusts \nthe weapons back in my hands. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I say. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cDo it. Before they send those mutts back or something. I \n\ndon\u2019t want to die like Cato,\u201d he says. \n\n\n\n \n\n338 \n \n\n\u201cThen you shoot me,\u201d I say furiously, shoving the weapons \nback at him. \u201cYou shoot me and go home and live with it!\u201d And \nas I say it, I know death right here, right now would be the \neasier of the two. \n\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t,\u201d Peeta says, discarding the weapons. \n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go first anyway.\u201d He leans down and rips the ban-\ndage off his leg, eliminating the final barrier between his \nblood and the earth. \n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t kill yourself,\u201d I say. I\u2019m on my knees, despe-\nrately plastering the bandage back onto his wound. \n\n\u201cKatniss,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what I want.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me here alone,\u201d I say. Because if he dies, \n\nI\u2019ll never go home, not really. I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life in \nthis arena trying to think my way out. \n\n\u201cListen,\u201d he says pulling me to my feet. \u201cWe both know they \nhave to have a victor. It can only be one of us. Please, take it. \nFor me.\u201d And he goes on about how he loves me, what life \nwould be without me but I\u2019ve stopped listening because his \nprevious words are trapped in my head, thrashing desperately \naround. \n\nWe both know they have to have a victor. \n\nYes, they have to have a victor. Without a victor, the whole \nthing would blow up in the Gamemakers\u2019 faces. They\u2019d have \nfailed the Capitol. Might possibly even be executed, slowly and \npainfully while the cameras broadcast it to every screen in the \ncountry. \n\nIf Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were . . . \n\n\n\n \n\n339 \n \n\nMy fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. \nPeeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t let \nyou.\u201d \n\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment \nthen lets me go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few \nspoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. \u201cOn the \ncount of three?\u201d \n\nPeeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. \u201cThe \ncount of three,\u201d he says. \n\nWe stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands \nlocked tight. \n\n\u201cHold them out. I want everyone to see,\u201d he says. \nI spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the \n\nsun. I give Peeta\u2019s hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-\nbye, and we begin counting. \u201cOne.\u201d Maybe I\u2019m wrong. \u201cTwo.\u201d \nMaybe they don\u2019t care if we both die. \u201cThree!\u201d It\u2019s too late to \nchange my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last \nlook at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when \nthe trumpets begin to blare. \n\nThe frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above \nthem. \u201cStop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to \npresent the victors of the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games, Kat-\nniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you \u2014 the tributes of \nDistrict Twelve!\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n340 \n \n\n \n \n \nI spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with \n\nthe end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. Peeta pulls \nme to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water \nand then collapse into each other\u2019s arms. \n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t swallow any?\u201d I ask him. \nHe shakes his head. \u201cYou?\u201d \n\u201cGuess I\u2019d be dead by now if I did,\u201d I say. I can see his lips \n\nmoving in reply, but I can\u2019t hear him over the roar of the \ncrowd in the Capitol that they\u2019re playing live over the speak-\ners. \n\nThe hovercraft materializes overhead and two ladders \ndrop, only there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting go of Peeta. I keep one \narm around him as I help him up, and we each place a foot on \nthe first rung of the ladder. The electric current freezes us in \nplace, and this time I\u2019m glad because I\u2019m not really sure Peeta \ncan hang on for the whole ride. And since my eyes were look-\ning down, I can see that while our muscles are immobile, noth-\ning is preventing the blood from draining out of Peeta\u2019s leg. \nSure enough, the minute the door closes behind us and the \ncurrent stops, he slumps to the floor unconscious. \n\nMy fingers are still gripping the back of his jacket so tightly \nthat when they take him away it tears leaving me with a fistful \n\n\n\n \n\n341 \n \n\nof black fabric. Doctors in sterile white, masked and gloved, \nalready prepped to operate, go into action. Peeta\u2019s so pale and \nstill on a silver table, tubes and wires springing out of him \nevery which way, and for a moment I forget we\u2019re out of the \nGames and I see the doctors as just one more threat, one more \npack of mutts designed to kill him. Petrified, I lunge for him, \nbut I\u2019m caught and thrust back into another room, and a glass \ndoor seals between us. I pound on the glass, screaming my \nhead off. Everyone ignores me except for some Capitol atten-\ndant who appears behind me and offers me a beverage. \n\nI slump down on the floor, my face against the door, staring \nuncomprehendingly at the crystal glass in my hand. Icy cold, \nfilled with orange juice, a straw with a frilly white collar. How \nwrong it looks in my bloody, filthy hand with its dirt-caked \nnails and scars. My mouth waters at the smell, but I place it \ncarefully on the floor, not trusting anything so clean and pret-\nty. \n\nThrough the glass, I see the doctors working feverishly on \nPeeta, their brows creased in concentration. I see the flow of \nliquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and \nlights that mean nothing to me. I\u2019m not sure, but I think his \nheart stops twice. \n\nIt\u2019s like being home again, when they bring in the hopeless-\nly mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in \nher third day of labor, or the famished child struggling against \npneumonia and my mother and Prim, they wear that same \nlook on their faces. Now is the time to run away to the woods, \nto hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in anoth-\n\n\n\n \n\n342 \n \n\ner part of the Seam the hammers make the coffin. But I\u2019m held \nhere both by the hovercraft walls and the same force that \nholds the loved ones of the dying. How often I\u2019ve seen them, \nringed around our kitchen table and I thought, Why don\u2019t they \n\nleave? Why do they stay to watch? \n\nAnd now I know. It\u2019s because you have no choice. \nI startle when I catch someone staring at me from only a \n\nfew inches away and then realize it\u2019s my own face reflecting \nback in the glass. Wild eyes, hollow cheeks, my hair in a tan-\ngled mat. Rabid. Feral. Mad. No wonder everyone is keeping a \nsafe distance from me. \n\nThe next thing I know we\u2019ve landed back on the roof of the \nTraining Center and they\u2019re taking Peeta but leaving me be-\nhind the door. I start hurling myself against the glass, shriek-\ning and I think I just catch a glimpse of pink hair \u2014 it must be \nEffie, it has to be Effie coming to my rescue \u2014 when the \nneedle jabs me from behind. \n\nWhen I wake, I\u2019m afraid to move at first. The entire ceiling \nglows with a soft yellow light allowing me to see that I\u2019m in a \nroom containing just my bed. No doors, no windows are visi-\nble. The air smells of something sharp and antiseptic. My right \narm has several tubes that extend into the wall behind me. I\u2019m \nnaked, but the bedclothes arc soothing against my skin. I ten-\ntatively lift my left hand above the cover. Not only has it been \nscrubbed clean, the nails are filed in perfect ovals, the scars \nfrom the burns are less prominent. I touch my cheek, my lips, \nthe puckered scar above my eyebrow, and am just running my \nfingers through my silken hair when I freeze. Apprehensively I \n\n\n\n \n\n343 \n \n\nruffle the hair by my left ear. No, it wasn\u2019t an illusion. I can \nhear again. \n\nI try and sit up, but some sort of wide restraining band \naround my waist keeps me from rising more than a few inch-\nes. The physical confinement makes me panic and I\u2019m trying \nto pull myself up and wriggle my hips through the band when \na portion of the wall slides open and in steps the redheaded \nAvox girl carrying a tray. The sight of her calms me and I stop \ntrying to escape. I want to ask her a million questions, but I\u2019m \nafraid any familiarity would cause her harm. Obviously I am \nbeing closely monitored. She sets the tray across my thighs \nand presses something that raises me to a sitting position. \nWhile she adjusts my pillows, I risk one question. I say it out \nloud, as clearly as my rusty voice will allow, so nothing will \nseem secretive. \u201cDid Peeta make it?\u201d She gives me a nod, and \nas she slips a spoon into my hand, I feel the pressure of friend-\nship. \n\nI guess she did not wish me dead after all. And Peeta has \nmade it. Of course, he did. With all their expensive equipment \nhere. Still, I hadn\u2019t been sure until now. \n\nAs the Avox leaves, the door closes noiselessly after her and \nI turn hungrily to the tray. A bowl of clear broth, a small serv-\ning of applesauce, and a glass of water. This is it? I think grou-\nchily. Shouldn\u2019t my homecoming dinner be a little more spec-\ntacular? But I find it\u2019s an effort to finish the spare meal before \nme. My stomach seems to have shrunk to the size of a chest-\nnut, and I have to wonder how long I\u2019ve been out because I \nhad no trouble eating a fairly sizable breakfast that last morn-\n\n\n\n \n\n344 \n \n\ning in the arena. There\u2019s usually a lag of a few days between \nthe end of the competition and the presentation of the victor \nso that they can put the starving, wounded, mess of a person \nback together again. Somewhere, Cinna and Portia will be \ncreating our wardrobes for the public appearances. Haymitch \nand Effie will be arranging the banquet for our sponsors, re-\nviewing the questions for our final interviews. Back home, \nDistrict 12 is probably in chaos as they try and organize the \nhomecoming celebrations for Peeta and me, given that the last \none was close to thirty years ago. \n\nHome! Prim and my mother! Gale! Even the thought of \nPrim\u2019s scruffy old cat makes me smile. Soon I will be home! \n\nI want to get out of this bed. To see Peeta and Cinna, to find \nout more about what\u2019s been going on. And why shouldn\u2019t I? I \nfeel fine. But as I start to work my way out of the band, I feel a \ncold liquid seeping into my vein from one of the tubes and al-\nmost immediately lose consciousness. \n\nThis happens on and off for an indeterminate amount of \ntime. My waking, eating, and, even though I resist the impulse \nto try and escape the bed, being knocked out again. I seem to \nbe in a strange, continual twilight. Only a few things register. \nThe redheaded Avox girl has not returned since the feeding, \nmy scars are disappearing, and do I imagine it? Or do I hear a \nman\u2019s voice yelling? Not in the Capitol accent, but in the \nrougher cadences of home. And I can\u2019t help having a vague, \ncomforting feeling that someone is looking out for me. \n\nThen finally, the time arrives when I come to and there\u2019s \nnothing plugged into my right arm. The restraint around my \n\n\n\n \n\n345 \n \n\nmiddle has been removed and I am free to move about. I start \nto sit up but am arrested by the sight of my hands. The skin\u2019s \nperfection, smooth and glowing. Not only are the scars from \nthe arena gone, but those accumulated over years of hunting \nhave vanished without a trace. My forehead feels like satin, \nand when I try to find the burn on my calf, there\u2019s nothing. \n\nI slip my legs out of bed, nervous about how they will bear \nmy weight and find them strong and steady. Lying at the foot \nof the bed is an outfit that makes me flinch. It\u2019s what all of us \ntributes wore in the arena. I stare at it as if it had teeth until I \nremember that, of course, this is what I will wear to greet my \nteam. \n\nI\u2019m dressed in less than a minute and fidgeting in front of \nthe wall where I know there\u2019s a door even if I can\u2019t see it when \nsuddenly it slides open. I step into a wide, deserted hall that \nappears to have no other doors on it. But it must. And behind \none of them must be Peeta. Now that I\u2019m conscious and mov-\ning, I\u2019m growing more and more anxious about him. He must \nbe all right or the Avox girl wouldn\u2019t have said so. But I need \nto see him for myself. \n\n\u201cPeeta!\u201d I call out, since there\u2019s no one to ask. I hear my \nname in response, but it\u2019s not his voice. It\u2019s a voice that pro-\nvokes first irritation and then eagerness. Effie. \n\nI turn and see them all waiting in a big chamber at the end \nof the hall \u2014 Effie, Haymitch, and Cinna. My feet take off with-\nout hesitation. Maybe a victor should show more restraint, \nmore superiority, especially when she knows this will be on \ntape, but I don\u2019t care. I run for them and surprise even myself \n\n\n\n \n\n346 \n \n\nwhen I launch into Haymitch\u2019s arms first. When he whispers \nin my ear, \u201cNice job, sweetheart,\u201d it doesn\u2019t sound sarcastic. \nEffie\u2019s somewhat teary and keeps patting my hair and talking \nabout how she told everyone we were pearls. Cinna just hugs \nme tight and doesn\u2019t say anything. Then I notice Portia is ab-\nsent and get a bad feeling. \n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Portia? Is she with Peeta? He is all right, isn\u2019t he? I \nmean, he\u2019s alive?\u201d I blurt out. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Only they want to do your reunion live on air at \nthe ceremony,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cOh. That\u2019s all,\u201d I say. The awful moment of thinking Peeta\u2019s \ndead again passes. \u201cI guess I\u2019d want to see that myself.\u201d \n\n\u201cGo on with Cinna. He has to get you ready,\u201d says Haymitch. \nIt\u2019s a relief to be alone with Cinna, to feel his protective arm \n\naround my shoulders as he guides me away from the cameras, \ndown a few passages and to an elevator that leads to the lobby \nof the Training Center. The hospital then is far underground, \neven beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying \nknots and throwing spears. The windows of the lobby are \ndarkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. No one else \nis there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. Our footsteps \necho in the emptiness. And when we ride up to the twelfth \nfloor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash \nacross my mind and there\u2019s a heavy, tight place in my chest. \n\nWhen the elevator doors open, Venia, Flavius, and Octavia \nengulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically I can\u2019t make out \ntheir words. The sentiment is clear though. They are truly \nthrilled to see me and I\u2019m happy to see them, too, although not \n\n\n\n \n\n347 \n \n\nlike I was to see Cinna. It\u2019s more in the way one might be glad \nto see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly \ndifficult day. \n\nThey sweep me into the dining room and I get a real meal \n\u2014 roast beef and peas and soft rolls \u2014 although my portions \nare still being strictly controlled. Because when I ask for \nseconds, I\u2019m refused. \n\n\u201cNo, no, no. They don\u2019t want it all coming back up on the \nstage,\u201d says Octavia, but she secretly slips me an extra roll un-\nder the table to let me know she\u2019s on my side. \n\nWe go back to my room and Cinna disappears for a while as \nthe prep team gets me ready. \n\n\u201cOh, they did a full body polish on you,\u201d says Flavius en-\nviously. \u201cNot a flaw left on your skin.\u201d \n\nBut when I look at my naked body in the mirror, all I can \nsee is how skinny I am. I mean, I\u2019m sure I was worse when I \ncame out of the arena, but I can easily count my ribs. \n\nThey take care of the shower settings for me, and they go to \nwork on my hair, nails, and makeup when I\u2019m done. They \nchatter so continuously that I barely have to reply, which is \ngood, since I don\u2019t feel very talkative. It\u2019s funny, because even \nthough they\u2019re rattling on about the Games, it\u2019s all about \nwhere they were or what they were doing or how they felt \nwhen a specific event occurred. \u201cI was still in bed!\u201d \u201cI had just \nhad my eyebrows dyed!\u201d \u201cI swear I nearly fainted!\u201d Everything \nis about them, not the dying boys and girls in the arena. \n\nWe don\u2019t wallow around in the Games this way in District \n12. We grit our teeth and watch because we must and try to \n\n\n\n \n\n348 \n \n\nget back to business as soon as possible when they\u2019re over. To \nkeep from hating the prep team, I effectively tune out most of \nwhat they\u2019re saying. \n\nCinna comes in with what appears to be an unassuming yel-\nlow dress across his arms. \n\n\u201cHave you given up the whole \u2018girl on fire\u2019 thing?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d he says, and slips it over my head. I imme-\n\ndiately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that \nhunger has stolen from my body. My hands go to my chest and \nI frown. \n\n\u201cI know,\u201d says Cinna before I can object. \u201cBut the Game-\nmakers wanted to alter you surgically. Haymitch had a huge \nfight with them over it. This was the compromise.\u201d He stops \nme before I can look at my reflection. \u201cWait, don\u2019t forget the \nshoes.\u201d Venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and I \nturn to the mirror. \n\nI am still the \u201cgirl on fire.\u201d The sheer fabric softly glows. \nEven the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my \nbody. By comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the \ninterview dress too contrived. In this dress, I give the illusion \nof wearing candlelight. \n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asks Cinna. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s the best yet,\u201d I say. When I manage to pull my \n\neyes away from the flickering fabric, I\u2019m in for something of a \nshock. My hair\u2019s loose, held back by a simple hairband. The \nmakeup rounds and fills out the sharp angles of my face. A \nclear polish coats my nails. The sleeveless dress is gathered at \nmy ribs, not my waist, largely eliminating any help the pad-\n\n\n\n \n\n349 \n \n\nding would have given my figure. The hem falls just to my \nknees. Without heels, you can see my true stature. I look, very \nsimply, like a girl. A young one. Fourteen at the most. Inno-\ncent. Harmless. Yes, it is shocking that Cinna has pulled this off \nwhen you remember I\u2019ve just won the Games. \n\nThis is a very calculated look. Nothing Cinna designs is ar-\nbitrary. I bite my lip trying to figure out his motivation. \n\n\u201cI thought it\u2019d be something more . . . sophisticated-\nlooking,\u201d I say. \n\n\u201cI thought Peeta would like this better,\u201d he answers careful-\nly. \n\nPeeta? No, it\u2019s not about Peeta. It\u2019s about the Capitol and \nthe Gamemakers and the audience. Although I do not yet un-\nderstand Cinna\u2019s design, it\u2019s a reminder the Games are not \nquite finished. And beneath his benign reply, I sense a warn-\ning. Of something he can\u2019t even mention in front of his own \nteam. \n\nWe take the elevator to the level where we trained. It\u2019s cus-\ntomary for the victor and his or her support team to rise from \nbeneath the stage. First the prep team, followed by the escort, \nthe stylist, the mentor, and finally the victor. Only this year, \nwith two victors who share both an escort and a mentor, the \nwhole thing has had to be rethought. I find myself in a poorly \nlit area under the stage. A brand-new metal plate has been in-\nstalled to transport me upward. You can still see small piles of \nsawdust, smell fresh paint. Cinna and the prep team peel off to \nchange into their own costumes and take their positions, leav-\n\n\n\n \n\n350 \n \n\ning me alone. In the gloom, I see a makeshift wall about ten \nyards away and assume Peeta\u2019s behind it. \n\nThe rumbling of the crowd is loud, so I don\u2019t notice Hay-\nmitch until he touches my shoulder. I spring away, startled, \nstill half in the arena, I guess. \n\n\u201cEasy, just me. Let\u2019s have a look at you,\u201d Haymitch says. I \nhold out my arms and turn once. \u201cGood enough.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s not much of a compliment. \u201cBut what?\u201d I say. \nHaymitch\u2019s eyes shift around my musty holding space, and \n\nhe seems to make a decision. \u201cBut nothing. How about a hug \nfor luck?\u201d \n\nOkay, that\u2019s an odd request from Haymitch but, after all, we \nare victors. Maybe a hug for luck is in order. Only, when I put \nmy arms around his neck, I find myself trapped in his em-\nbrace. He begins talking, very fast, very quietly in my ear, my \nhair concealing his lips. \n\n\u201cListen up. You\u2019re in trouble. Word is the Capitol\u2019s furious \nabout you showing them up in the arena. The one thing they \ncan\u2019t stand is being laughed at and they\u2019re the joke of Panem,\u201d \nsays Haymitch. \n\nI feel dread coursing through me now, but I laugh as though \nHaymitch is saying something completely delightful because \nnothing is covering my mouth. \u201cSo, what?\u201d \n\n\u201cYour only defense can be you were so madly in love you \nweren\u2019t responsible for your actions.\u201d Haymitch pulls back \nand adjusts my hairband. \u201cGot it, sweetheart?\u201d He could be \ntalking about anything now. \n\n\u201cGot it,\u201d I say. \u201cDid you tell Peeta this?\u201d \n\n\n\n \n\n351 \n \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to,\u201d says Haymitch. \u201cHe\u2019s already there.\u201d \n\u201cBut you think I\u2019m not?\u201d I say, taking the opportunity to \n\nstraighten a bright red bow tie Cinna must have wrestled him \ninto. \n\n\u201cSince when does it matter what I think?\u201d says Haymitch. \n\u201cBetter take our places.\u201d He leads me to the metal circle. \u201cThis \nis your night, sweetheart. Enjoy it.\u201d He kisses me on the fore-\nhead and disappears into the gloom. \n\nI tug on my skirt, willing it to be longer, wanting it to cover \nthe knocking in my knees. Then I realize it\u2019s pointless. My \nwhole body\u2019s shaking like a leaf. Hopefully, it will be put down \nto excitement. After all, it\u2019s my night. \n\nThe damp, moldy smell beneath the stage threatens to \nchoke me. A cold, clammy sweat breaks out on my skin and I \ncan\u2019t rid myself of the feeling that the boards above my head \nare about to collapse, to bury me alive under the rubble. When \nI left the arena, when the trumpets played, I was supposed to \nbe safe. From then on. For the rest of my life. But if what Hay-\nmitch says is true, and he\u2019s got no reason to lie, I\u2019ve never \nbeen in such a dangerous place in my life. \n\nIt\u2019s so much worse than being hunted in the arena. There, I \ncould only die. End of story. But out here Prim, my mother, \nGale, the people of District 12, everyone I care about back \nhome could be punished if I can\u2019t pull off the girl-driven-\ncrazy-by-love scenario Haymitch has suggested. \n\nSo I still have a chance, though. Funny, in the arena, when I \npoured out those berries, I was only thinking of outsmarting \nthe Gamemakers, not how my actions would reflect on the Ca-\n\n\n\n \n\n352 \n \n\npitol. But the Hunger Games are their weapon and you are not \nsupposed to be able to defeat it. So now the Capitol will act as \nif they\u2019ve been in control the whole time. As if they orches-\ntrated the whole event, right down to the double suicide. But \nthat will only work if I play along with them. \n\nAnd Peeta . . . Peeta will suffer, too, if this goes wrong. But \nwhat was it Haymitch said when I asked if he had told Peeta \nthe situation? That he had to pretend to be desperately in \nlove? \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to. He\u2019s already there.\u201d \n\nAlready thinking ahead of me in the Games again and well \naware of the danger we\u2019re in? Or . . . already desperately in \nlove? I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t even begun to separate out my \nfeelings about Peeta. It\u2019s too complicated. What I did as part of \nthe Games. As opposed to what I did out of anger at the Capi-\ntol. Or because of how it would be viewed back in District 12. \nOr simply because it was the only decent thing to do. Or what I \ndid because I cared about him. \n\nThese are questions to be unraveled back home, in the \npeace and quiet of the woods, when no one is watching. Not \nhere with every eye upon me. But I won\u2019t have that luxury for \nwho knows how long. And right now, the most dangerous part \nof the Hunger Games is about to begin. \n\n\n\n \n\n353 \n \n\n  \n \n \nThe anthem booms in my ears, and then I hear Caesar \n\nFlickerman greeting the audience. Does he know how crucial \nit is to get every word right from now on? He must. He will \nwant to help us. The crowd breaks into applause as the prep \nteams are presented. I imagine Flavius, Venia, and Octavia \nbouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. It\u2019s a \nsafe bet they\u2019re clueless. Then Effie\u2019s introduced. How long \nshe\u2019s waited for this moment. I hope she\u2019s able to enjoy it be-\ncause as misguided as Effie can be, she has a very keen in-\nstinct about certain things and must at least suspect we\u2019re in \ntrouble. Portia and Cinna receive huge cheers, of course, \nthey\u2019ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. I now understand \nCinna\u2019s choice of dress for me for tonight. I\u2019ll need to look as \ngirlish and innocent as possible. Haymitch\u2019s appearance \nbrings a round of stomping that goes on at least five minutes. \nWell, he\u2019s accomplished a first. Keeping not only one but two \ntributes alive. What if he hadn\u2019t warned me in time? Would I \nhave acted differently? Flaunted the moment with the berries \nin the Capitol\u2019s face? No, I don\u2019t think so. But I could easily \nhave been a lot less convincing than I need to be now. Right \nnow. Because I can feel the plate lifting me up to the stage. \n\n\n\n \n\n354 \n \n\nBlinding lights. The deafening roar rattles the metal under \nmy feet. Then there\u2019s Peeta just a few yards away. He looks so \nclean and healthy and beautiful, I can hardly recognize him. \nBut his smile is the same whether in mud or in the Capitol and \nwhen I see it, I take about three steps and fling myself into his \narms. He staggers back, almost losing his balance, and that\u2019s \nwhen I realize the slim, metal contraption in his hand is some \nkind of cane. He rights himself and we just cling to each other \nwhile the audience goes insane. He\u2019s kissing me and all the \ntime I\u2019m thinking, Do you know? Do you know how much dan-\n\nger we\u2019re in? After about ten minutes of this, Caesar Flicker-\nman taps on his shoulder to continue the show, and Peeta just \npushes him aside without even glancing at him. The audience \ngoes berserk. Whether he knows or not, Peeta is, as usual, \nplaying the crowd exactly right. \n\nFinally, Haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured \nshove toward the victor\u2019s chair. Usually, this is a single, ornate \nchair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the \nhighlights of the Games, but since there are two of us, the Ga-\nmemakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. A small \none, my mother would call it a love seat, I think. I sit so close \nto Peeta that I\u2019m practically on his lap, but one look from \nHaymitch tells me it isn\u2019t enough. Kicking off my sandals, I \ntuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta\u2019s \nshoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel \nlike I\u2019m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep \nwarm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my \ndress, but Portia\u2019s put him in long black pants. No sandals, ei-\n\n\n\n \n\n355 \n \n\nther, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted \non the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel \nso vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the \npoint. \n\nCaesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it\u2019s \ntime for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is re-\nquired viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal \nappears on the screen, I realize I\u2019m unprepared for this. I do \nnot want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw \nenough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding \nand I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors \nfaced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show \nthe winner\u2019s reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I \nthink back to earlier years . . . some are triumphant, pumping \ntheir fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem \nstunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on this \nlove seat is Peeta \u2014 his arm around my shoulder, his other \nhand claimed by both of mine. Of course, the previous victors \ndidn\u2019t have the Capitol looking for a way to destroy them. \n\nCondensing several weeks into three hours is quite a feat, \nespecially when you consider how many cameras were going \nat once. Whoever puts together the highlights has to choose \nwhat sort of story to tell. This year, for the first time, they tell \na love story. I know Peeta and I won, but a disproportionate \namount of time is spent on us, right from the beginning. I\u2019m \nglad though, because it supports the whole crazy-in-love thing \nthat\u2019s my defense for defying the Capitol, plus it means we \nwon\u2019t have as much time to linger over the deaths. \n\n\n\n \n\n356 \n \n\nThe first half hour or so focuses on the pre-arena events, \nthe reaping, the chariot ride through the Capitol, our training \nscores, and our interviews. There\u2019s this sort of upbeat \nsoundtrack playing under it that makes it twice as awful be-\ncause, of course, almost everyone on-screen is dead. \n\nOnce we\u2019re in the arena, there\u2019s detailed coverage of the \nbloodbath and then the filmmakers basically alternate be-\ntween shots of tributes dying and shots of us. Mostly Peeta re-\nally, there\u2019s no question he\u2019s carrying this romance thing on \nhis shoulders. Now I see what the audience saw, how he \nmisled the Careers about me, stayed awake the entire night \nunder the tracker jacker tree, fought Cato to let me escape and \neven while he lay in that mud bank, whispered my name in his \nsleep. I seem heartless in comparison \u2014 dodging fireballs, \ndropping nests, and blowing up supplies \u2014 until I go hunting \nfor Rue. They play her death in full, the spearing, my failed \nrescue attempt, my arrow through the boy from District 1\u2019s \nthroat, Rue drawing her last breath in my arms. And the song. \nI get to sing every note of the song. Something inside me shuts \ndown and I\u2019m too numb to feel anything. It\u2019s like watching \ncomplete strangers in another Hunger Games. But I do notice \nthey omit the part where I covered her in flowers. \n\nRight. Because even that smacks of rebellion. \nThings pick up for me once they\u2019ve announced two tributes \n\nfrom the same district can live and I shout out Peeta\u2019s name \nand then clap my hands over my mouth. If I\u2019ve seemed indiffe-\nrent to him earlier, I make up for it now, by finding him, nurs-\ning him back to health, going to the feast for the medicine, and \n\n\n\n \n\n357 \n \n\nbeing very free with my kisses. Objectively, I can see the mutts \nand Cato\u2019s death are as gruesome as ever, but again, I feel it \nhappens to people I have never met. \n\nAnd then comes the moment with the berries. I can hear \nthe audience hushing one another, not wanting to miss any-\nthing. A wave of gratitude to the filmmakers sweeps over me \nwhen they end not with the announcement of our victory, but \nwith me pounding on the glass door of the hovercraft, scream-\ning Peeta\u2019s name as they try to revive him. \n\nIn terms of survival, it\u2019s my best moment all night. \nThe anthem\u2019s playing yet again and we rise as President \n\nSnow himself takes the stage followed by a little girl carrying \na cushion that holds the crown. There\u2019s just one crown, \nthough, and you can hear the crowd\u2019s confusion \u2014 whose \nhead will he place it on? \u2014 until President Snow gives it a \ntwist and it separates into two halves. He places the first \naround Peeta\u2019s brow with a smile. He\u2019s still smiling when he \nsettles the second on my head, but his eyes, just inches from \nmine, are as unforgiving as a snake\u2019s. \n\nThat\u2019s when I know that even though both of us would have \neaten the berries, I am to blame for having the idea. I\u2019m the in-\nstigator. I\u2019m the one to be punished. \n\nMuch bowing and cheering follows. My arm is about to fall \noff from waving when Caesar Flickerman finally bids the au-\ndience good night, reminding them to tune in tomorrow for \nthe final interviews. As if they have a choice. \n\nPeeta and I are whisked to the president\u2019s mansion for the \nVictory Banquet, where we have very little time to eat as Capi-\n\n\n\n \n\n358 \n \n\ntol officials and particularly generous sponsors elbow one \nanother out of the way as they try to get their picture with us. \nFace after beaming face flashes by, becoming increasingly in-\ntoxicated as the evening wears on. Occasionally, I catch a \nglimpse of Haymitch, which is reassuring, or President Snow, \nwhich is terrifying, but I keep laughing and thanking people \nand smiling as my picture is taken. The one thing I never do is \nlet go of Peeta\u2019s hand. \n\nThe sun is just peeking over the horizon when we straggle \nback to the twelfth floor of the Training Center. I think now I\u2019ll \nfinally get a word alone with Peeta, but Haymitch sends him \noff with Portia to get something fitted for the interview and \npersonally escorts me to my door. \n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I talk to him?\u201d I ask. \n\u201cPlenty of time for talk when we get home,\u201d says Haymitch. \n\n\u201cGo to bed, you\u2019re on air at two.\u201d \nDespite Haymitch\u2019s running interference, I\u2019m determined to \n\nsee Peeta privately. After I toss and turn for a few hours, I slip \ninto the hall. My first thought is to check the roof, but it\u2019s emp-\nty. Even the city streets far below are deserted after the cele-\nbration last night. I go back to bed for a while and then decide \nto go directly to his room, but when I try to turn the knob, I \nfind my own bedroom door has been locked from the outside. \nI suspect Haymitch initially, but then there\u2019s a more insidious \nfear that the Capitol may by monitoring and confining me. I\u2019ve \nbeen unable to escape since the Hunger Games began, but this \nfeels different, much more personal. This feels like I\u2019ve been \nimprisoned for a crime and I\u2019m awaiting sentencing. I quickly \n\n\n\n \n\n359 \n \n\nget back in bed and pretend to sleep until Effie Trinket comes \nto alert me to the start of another \u201cbig, big, big day!\u201d \n\nI have about five minutes to eat a bowl of hot grain and \nstew before the prep team descends. All I have to say is, \u201cThe \ncrowd loved you!\u201d and it\u2019s unnecessary to speak for the next \ncouple of hours. When Cinna comes in, he shoos them out and \ndresses me in a white, gauzy dress and pink shoes. Then he \npersonally adjusts my makeup until I seem to radiate a soft, \nrosy glow. We make idle chitchat, but I\u2019m afraid to ask him \nanything of real importance because after the incident with \nthe door, I can\u2019t shake the feeling that I\u2019m being watched con-\nstantly. \n\nThe interview takes place right down the hall in the sitting \nroom. A space has been cleared and the love seat has been \nmoved in and surrounded by vases of red and pink roses. \nThere are only a handful of cameras to record the event. No \nlive audience at least. \n\nCaesar Flickerman gives me a warm hug when I. come in. \n\u201cCongratulations, Katniss. How are you faring?\u201d \n\n\u201cFine. Nervous about the interview,\u201d I say. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be. We\u2019re going to have a fabulous time,\u201d he says, \n\ngiving my cheek a reassuring pat. \n\u201cI\u2019m not good at talking about myself,\u201d I say. \n\u201cNothing you say will be wrong,\u201d he says. \nAnd I think, Oh, Caesar, if only that were true. But actually, \n\nPresident Snow may be arranging some sort of \u201caccident\u201d for \n\nme as we speak. \n\n\n\n \n\n360 \n \n\nThen Peeta\u2019s there looking handsome in red and white, \npulling me off to the side. \u201cI hardly get to see you. Haymitch \nseems bent on keeping us apart.\u201d \n\nHaymitch is actually bent on keeping us alive, but there are \ntoo many ears listening, so I just say, \u201cYes, he\u2019s gotten very re-\nsponsible lately.\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s just this and we go home. Then he can\u2019t watch \nus all the time,\u201d says Peeta. \n\nI feel a sort of shiver run through me and there\u2019s no time to \nanalyze why, because they\u2019re ready for us. We sit somewhat \nformally on the love seat, but Caesar says, \u201cOh, go ahead and \ncurl up next to him if you want. It looked very sweet.\u201d So I tuck \nmy feet up and Peeta pulls me in close to him. \n\nSomeone counts backward and just like that, we\u2019re being \nbroadcast live to the entire country. Caesar Flickerman is \nwonderful, teasing, joking, getting choked up when the occa-\nsion presents itself. He and Peeta already have the rapport \nthey established that night of the first interview, that easy \nbanter, so I just smile a lot and try to speak as little as possi-\nble. I mean, I have to talk some, but as soon as I can I redirect \nthe conversation back to Peeta. \n\nEventually though, Caesar begins to pose questions that in-\nsist on fuller answers. \u201cWell, Peeta, we know, from our days in \nthe cave, that it was love at first sight for you from what, age \nfive?\u201d Caesar says. \n\n\u201cFrom the moment I laid eyes on her,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\n\n \n\n361 \n \n\n\u201cBut, Katniss, what a ride for you. I think the real excite-\nment for the audience was watching you fall for him. When \ndid you realize you were in love with him?\u201d asks Caesar. \n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s a hard one . . .\u201d I give a faint, breathy laugh and \nlook down at my hands. Help. \n\n\u201cWell, I know when it hit me. The night when you shouted \nout his name from that tree,\u201d says Caesar. \n\nThank you, Caesar! I think, and then go with his idea. \u201cYes, I \nguess that was it. I mean, until that point, I just tried not to \nthink about what my feelings might be, honestly, because it \nwas so confusing and it only made things worse if I actually \ncared about him. But then, in the tree, everything changed,\u201d I \nsay. \n\n\u201cWhy do you think that was?\u201d urges Caesar. \n\u201cMaybe . . . because for the first time . . . there was a chance \n\nI could keep him,\u201d I say. \nBehind a cameraman, I see Haymitch give a sort of huff \n\nwith relief and I know I\u2019ve said the right thing. Caesar pulls \nout a handkerchief and has to take a moment because he\u2019s so \nmoved. I can feel Peeta press his forehead into my temple and \nhe asks, \u201cSo now that you\u2019ve got me, what are you going to do \nwith me?\u201d \n\nI turn in to him. \u201cPut you somewhere you can\u2019t get hurt.\u201d \nAnd when he kisses me, people in the room actually sigh. \n\nFor Caesar, this is a natural place to segue into all the ways \nwe did get hurt in the arena, from burns, to stings, to wounds. \nBut it\u2019s not until we get around to the mutts that I forget I\u2019m \n\n\n\n \n\n362 \n \n\non camera. When Caesar asks Peeta how his \u201cnew leg\u201d is \nworking out. \n\n\u201cNew leg?\u201d I say, and I can\u2019t help reaching out and pulling \nup the bottom of Peeta\u2019s pants. \u201cOh, no,\u201d I whisper, taking in \nthe metal-and-plastic device that has replaced his flesh. \n\n\u201cNo one told you?\u201d asks Caesar gently. I shake my head. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance,\u201d says Peeta with a slight shrug. \n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause I used that tourniquet.\u201d \n\u201cYes, it\u2019s your fault I\u2019m alive,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d says Caesar. \u201cHe\u2019d have bled to death for sure \n\nwithout it.\u201d \nI guess this is true, but I can\u2019t help feeling upset about it to \n\nthe extent that I\u2019m afraid I might cry and then I remember \neveryone in the country is watching me so I just bury my face \nin Peeta\u2019s shirt. It takes them a couple of minutes to coax me \nback out because it\u2019s better in the shirt, where no one can see \nme, and when I do come out, Caesar backs off questioning me \nso I can recover. In fact, he pretty much leaves me alone until \nthe berries come up. \n\n\u201cKatniss, I know you\u2019ve had a shock, but I\u2019ve got to ask. The \nmoment when you pulled out those berries. What was going \non in your mind . . . hm?\u201d he says. \n\nI take a long pause before I answer, trying to collect my \nthoughts. This is the crucial moment where I either challenged \nthe Capitol or went so crazy at the idea of losing Peeta that I \ncan\u2019t be held responsible for my actions. It seems to call for a \nbig, dramatic speech, but all I get out is one almost inaudible \n\n\n\n \n\n363 \n \n\nsentence. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just . . . couldn\u2019t bear the thought of . \n. . being without him.\u201d \n\n\u201cPeeta? Anything to add?\u201d asks Caesar. \n\u201cNo. I think that goes for both of us,\u201d he says. \nCaesar signs off and it\u2019s over. Everyone\u2019s laughing and cry-\n\ning and hugging, but I\u2019m still not sure until I reach Haymitch. \n\u201cOkay?\u201d I whisper. \n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he answers. \nI go back to my room to collect a few things and find there\u2019s \n\nnothing to take but the mockingjay pin Madge gave me. Some-\none returned it to my room after the Games. They drive us \nthrough the streets in a car with blackened windows, and the \ntrain\u2019s waiting for us. We barely have time to say good-bye to \nCinna and Portia, although we\u2019ll see them in a few months, \nwhen we tour the districts for a round of victory ceremonies. \nIt\u2019s the Capitol\u2019s way of reminding people that the Hunger \nGames never really go away. We\u2019ll be given a lot of useless \nplaques, and everyone will have to pretend they love us. \n\nThe train begins moving and we\u2019re plunged into night until \nwe clear the tunnel and I take my first free breath since the \nreaping. Effie is accompanying us back and Haymitch, too, of \ncourse. We eat an enormous dinner and settle into silence in \nfront of the television to watch a replay of the interview. With \nthe Capitol growing farther away every second, I begin to \nthink of home. Of Prim and my mother. Of Gale. I excuse my-\nself to change out of my dress and into a plain shirt and pants. \nAs I slowly, thoroughly wash the makeup from my face and \nput my hair in its braid, I begin transforming back into myself. \n\n\n\n \n\n364 \n \n\nKatniss Everdeen. A girl who lives in the Seam. Hunts in the \nwoods. Trades in the Hob. I stare in the mirror as I try to re-\nmember who I am and who I am not. By the time I join the \nothers, the pressure of Peeta\u2019s arm around my shoulders feels \nalien. \n\nWhen the train makes a brief stop for fuel, we\u2019re allowed to \ngo outside for some fresh air. There\u2019s no longer any need to \nguard us. Peeta and I walk down along the track, hand in hand, \nand I can\u2019t find anything to say now that we\u2019re alone. He stops \nto gather a bunch of wildflowers for me. When he presents \nthem, I work hard to look pleased. Because he can\u2019t know that \nthe pink-and-white flowers are the tops of wild onions and \nonly remind me of the hours I\u2019ve spent gathering them with \nGale. \n\nGale. The idea of seeing Gale in a matter of hours makes my \nstomach churn. But why? I can\u2019t quite frame it in my mind. I \nonly know that I feel like I\u2019ve been lying to someone who \ntrusts me. Or more accurately, to two people. I\u2019ve been getting \naway with it up to this point because of the Games. But there \nwill be no Games to hide behind back home. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Peeta asks. \n\u201cNothing,\u201d I answer. We continue walking, past the end of \n\nthe train, out where even I\u2019m fairly sure there are no cameras \nhidden in the scrubby bushes along the track. Still no words \ncome. \n\nHaymitch startles me when he lays a hand on my back. \nEven now, in the middle of nowhere, he keeps his voice down. \n\u201cGreat job, you two. Just keep it up in the district until the \n\n\n\n \n\n365 \n \n\ncameras are gone. We should be okay.\u201d I watch him head back \nto the train, avoiding Peeta\u2019s eyes. \n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he mean?\u201d Peeta asks me. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the Capitol. They didn\u2019t like our stunt with the berries,\u201d \n\nI blurt out. \n\u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d he says. \n\u201cIt seemed too rebellious. So, Haymitch has been coaching \n\nme through the last few days. So I didn\u2019t make it worse,\u201d I say. \n\u201cCoaching you? But not me,\u201d says Peeta. \n\u201cHe knew you were smart enough to get it right,\u201d I say. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t know there was anything to get right,\u201d says Peeta. \n\n\u201cSo, what you\u2019re saying is, these last few days and then I guess \n. . . back in the arena . . . that was just some strategy you two \nworked out.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo. I mean, I couldn\u2019t even talk to him in the arena, could \nI?\u201d I stammer. \n\n\u201cBut you knew what he wanted you to do, didn\u2019t you?\u201d says \nPeeta. I bite my lip. \u201cKatniss?\u201d He drops my hand and I take a \nstep, as if to catch my balance. \n\n\u201cIt was all for the Games,\u201d Peeta says. \u201cHow you acted.\u201d \n\u201cNot all of it,\u201d I say, tightly holding onto my flowers. \n\u201cThen how much? No, forget that. I guess the real question \n\nis what\u2019s going to be left when we get home?\u201d he says. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know. The closer we get to District Twelve, the \n\nmore confused I get,\u201d I say. He waits, for further explanation, \nbut none\u2019s forthcoming. \n\n\u201cWell, let me know when you work it out,\u201d he says, and the \npain in his voice is palpable. \n\n\n\n \n\n366 \n \n\nI know my ears are healed because, even with the rumble \nof the engine, I can hear every step he takes back to the train. \nBy the time I\u2019ve climbed aboard, Peeta has disappeared into \nhis room for the night. I don\u2019t see him the next morning, ei-\nther. In fact, the next time he turns up, we\u2019re pulling into Dis-\ntrict 12. He gives me a nod, his face expressionless. \n\nI want to tell him that he\u2019s not being fair. That we were \nstrangers. That I did what it took to stay alive, to keep us both \nalive in the arena. That I can\u2019t explain how things are with \nGale because I don\u2019t know myself. That it\u2019s no good loving me \nbecause I\u2019m never going to get married anyway and he\u2019d just \nend up hating me later instead of sooner. That if I do have feel-\nings for him, it doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019ll never be able to af-\nford the kind of love that leads to a family, to children. And \nhow can he? How can he after what we\u2019ve just been through? \n\nI also want to tell him how much I already miss him. But \nthat wouldn\u2019t be fair on my part. \n\nSo we just stand there silently, watching our grimy little \nstation rise up around us. Through the window, I can see the \nplatform\u2019s thick with cameras. Everyone will be eagerly \nwatching our homecoming. \n\nOut of the corner of my eye, I see Peeta extend his hand. I \nlook at him, unsure. \u201cOne more time? For the audience?\u201d he \nsays. His voice isn\u2019t angry. It\u2019s hollow, which is worse. Already \nthe boy with the bread is slipping away from me. \n\nI take his hand, holding on tightly, preparing for the cam-\neras, and dreading the moment when I will finally have to let \ngo. \n\n\n\n \n\n367 \n \n\n \n \n\nEND OF BOOK ONE \n\n\n", "status": 200}}
