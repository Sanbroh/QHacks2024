They \nwere the last people you\u2019d expect to be involved in anything \nstrange or mysterious, because they just didn\u2019t hold with such \nnonsense. \n\nMr Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which \nmade drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, \nalthough he did have a very large moustache. Mrs Dursley was \nthin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, \nwhich came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning \nover garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a \nsmall son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer \nboy anywhere. \n\nThe Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a \nsecret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover \nit. They didn\u2019t think they could bear it if anyone found out about \nthe Potters. Mrs Potter was Mrs Dursley\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t \nmet for several years; in fact, Mrs Dursley pretended she didn\u2019t \nhave a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband \nwere as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys \nshuddered to think what the neighbours would say if the Potters \narrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a \nsmall son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was \nanother good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t \nwant Dudley mixing with a child like that. \n\nWhen Mr and Mrs Dursley woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday \nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to \nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be hap-\npening all over the country. Mr Dursley hummed as he picked out \nhis most boring tie for work and Mrs Dursley gossiped away \n\n\n\n8 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nhappily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. \nNone of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window. \nAt half past eight, Mr Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked \n\nMrs Dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss Dudley goodbye but \nmissed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing \nhis cereal at the walls. \u2018Little tyke,\u2019 chortled Mr Dursley as he left \nthe house. He got into his car and backed out of number four\u2019s \ndrive. \n\nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign \nof something peculiar \u2013 a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr \nDursley didn\u2019t realise what he had seen \u2013 then he jerked his head \naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \nof Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could \nhe have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. \nMr Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr \nDursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the \ncat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive \n\u2013 no, looking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr \nDursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his \nmind. As he drove towards town he thought of nothing except a \nlarge order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \n\nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by \nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he \ncouldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely \ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr Dursley couldn\u2019t bear \npeople who dressed in funny clothes \u2013 the get-ups you saw on \nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He \ndrummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a \nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-\npering excitedly together. Mr Dursley was enraged to see that a \ncouple of them weren\u2019t young at all; why, that man had to be older \nthan he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of \nhim! But then it struck Mr Dursley that this was probably some \nsilly stunt \u2013 these people were obviously collecting for something \n... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on, and a few minutes \nlater, Mr Dursley arrived in the Grunnings car park, his mind \nback on drills. \n\nMr Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office \non the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to \nconcentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls \n\n\n\n THE  BOY  WHO  LIVED 9 \n \n\n \n\nswooping past in broad daylight, though people down in the \nstreet did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl \nsped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at night-\ntime. Mr Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morn-\ning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important \ntelephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good \nmood until lunch-time, when he thought he\u2019d stretch his legs \nand walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the baker\u2019s \nopposite. \n\nHe\u2019d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a \ngroup of them next to the baker\u2019s. He eyed them angrily as he \npassed. He didn\u2019t know why, but they made him uneasy. This lot \nwere whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn\u2019t see a single \ncollecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large \ndoughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were \nsaying. \n\n\u2018The Potters, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s what I heard \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018\u2013 yes, their son, Harry \u2013\u2019 \nMr Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at \n\nthe whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but \nthought better of it. \n\nHe dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, \nsnapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone \nand had almost finished dialling his home number when he \nchanged his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his \nmoustache, thinking ... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t \nsuch an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people \ncalled Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he \nwasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even \nseen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no \npoint in worrying Mrs Dursley, she always got so upset at any \nmention of her sister. He didn\u2019t blame her \u2013 if he\u2019d had a sister like \nthat ... but all the same, those people in cloaks ... \n\nHe found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon, \nand when he left the building at five o\u2019clock, he was still so \nworried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \n\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost \nfell. It was a few seconds before Mr Dursley realised that the man \nwas wearing a violet cloak. He didn\u2019t seem at all upset at being \nalmost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into \n\n\n\n10 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\na wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passers-by \nstare: \u2018Don\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me \ntoday! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even \nMuggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy happy \nday!\u2019 \n\nAnd the old man hugged Mr Dursley around the middle and \nwalked off. \n\nMr Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a \ncomplete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, \nwhatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set \noff home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never \nhoped before, because he didn\u2019t approve of imagination. \n\nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he \nsaw \u2013 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2013 was the tabby cat he\u2019d \nspotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was \nsure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n\n\u2018Shoo!\u2019 said Mr Dursley loudly. \nThe cat didn\u2019t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this nor-\n\nmal cat behaviour, Mr Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself \ntogether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined \nnot to mention anything to his wife. \n\nMrs Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over din-\nner all about Mrs Next Door\u2019s problems with her daughter and \nhow Dudley had learnt a new word (\u2018Shan\u2019t!\u2019). Mr Dursley tried to \nact normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the \nliving-room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \n\nAnd finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the \nnation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although \nowls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, \nthere have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in \nevery direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why \nthe owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\u2019 The news \nreader allowed himself a grin. \u2018Most mysterious. And now, over to \nJim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of \nowls tonight, Jim?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Well, Ted,\u2019 said the weatherman, \u2018I don\u2019t know about that, but \nit\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as \nfar apart as Kent, Yorkshire and Dundee have been phoning in \nto tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve \nhad a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been \n\n\n\n THE  BOY  WHO  LIVED 11 \n \n\n \n\ncelebrating Bonfire Night early \u2013 it\u2019s not until next week, folks! \nBut I can promise a wet night tonight.\u2019 \n\nMr Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over \nBritain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all \nover the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters ... \n\nMrs Dursley came into the living-room carrying two cups of \ntea. It was no good. He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared \nhis throat nervously. \u2018Er \u2013 Petunia, dear \u2013 you haven\u2019t heard from \nyour sister lately, have you?\u2019 \n\nAs he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry. \nAfter all, they normally pretended she didn\u2019t have a sister. \n\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said sharply. \u2018Why?\u2019 \n\u2018Funny stuff on the news,\u2019 Mr Dursley mumbled. \u2018Owls ... \n\nshooting stars ... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in \ntown today ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018So?\u2019 snapped Mrs Dursley. \n\u2018Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... \n\nyou know ... her lot.\u2019 \nMrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley \n\nwondered whether he dared tell her he\u2019d heard the name \u2018Potter\u2019. \nHe decided he didn\u2019t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \n\u2018Their son \u2013 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u2019 \n\n\u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Mrs Dursley stiffly. \n\u2018What\u2019s his name again? Howard, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \n\u2018Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \u2018Yes, I \n\nquite agree.\u2019 \nHe didn\u2019t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs \n\nto bed. While Mrs Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr Dursley crept \nto the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. \nThe cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though \nit was waiting for something. \n\nWas he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do \nwith the Potters? If it did ... if it got out that they were related to a \npair of \u2013 well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it. \n\nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs Dursley fell asleep quickly but \nMr Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, \ncomforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the \nPotters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near \nhim and Mrs Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and \n\n\n\n12 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nPetunia thought about them and their kind ... He couldn\u2019t see how \nhe and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be \ngoing on. He yawned and turned over. It couldn\u2019t affect them ... \n\nHow very wrong he was. \nMr Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but \n\nthe cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It \nwas sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the \nfar corner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car \ndoor slammed in the next street, nor when two owls swooped \noverhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \n\nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, \nappeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just \npopped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes \nnarrowed. \n\nNothing like this man had ever been seen in Privet Drive. He \nwas tall, thin and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and \nbeard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was \nwearing long robes, a purple cloak which swept the ground and \nhigh-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright and \nsparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long \nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This \nman\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore. \n\nAlbus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realise that he had just \narrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots \nwas unwelcome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for \nsomething. But he did seem to realise he was being watched, \nbecause he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring \nat him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight \nof the cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u2018I \nshould have known.\u2019 \n\nHe had found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It \nseemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it \nup in the air and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with \na little pop. He clicked it again \u2013 the next lamp flickered into \ndarkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only \nlights left in the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the dis-\ntance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone \nlooked out of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs Dursley, \nthey wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything that was happening down \non the pavement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside \n\n\n\n THE  BOY  WHO  LIVED 13 \n \n\n \n\nhis cloak and set off down the street towards number four, where \nhe sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but \nafter a moment he spoke to it. \n\n\u2018Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u2019 \nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was \n\nsmiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square \nglasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around \nits eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black \nhair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled. \n\n\u2018How did you know it was me?\u2019 she asked. \n\u2018My dear Professor, I\u2019ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019d be stiff if you\u2019d been sitting on a brick wall all day,\u2019 said \n\nProfessor McGonagall. \n\u2018All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have \n\npassed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall sniffed angrily. \n\u2018Oh yes, everyone\u2019s celebrating, all right,\u2019 she said impatiently. \n\n\u2018You\u2019d think they\u2019d be a bit more careful, but no \u2013 even the \nMuggles have noticed something\u2019s going on. It was on their news.\u2019 \nShe jerked her head back at the Dursleys\u2019 dark living-room \nwindow. \u2018I heard it. Flocks of owls ... shooting stars ... Well, \nthey\u2019re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice \nsomething. Shooting stars down in Kent \u2013 I\u2019ll bet that was Dedalus \nDiggle. He never had much sense.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You can\u2019t blame them,\u2019 said Dumbledore gently. \u2018We\u2019ve had \nprecious little to celebrate for eleven years.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I know that,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall irritably. \u2018But that\u2019s no \nreason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out \non the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle \nclothes, swapping rumours.\u2019 \n\nShe threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as \nthough hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn\u2019t, \nso she went on: \u2018A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-\nKnow-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found \nout about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?\u2019 \n\n\u2018It certainly seems so,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018We have much to be \nthankful for. Would you care for a sherbet lemon?\u2019 \n\n\u2018A what?\u2019 \n\u2018A sherbet lemon. They\u2019re a kind of Muggle sweet I\u2019m rather \n\nfond of.\u2019 \n\n\n\n14 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018No, thank you,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though \nshe didn\u2019t think this was the moment for sherbet lemons. \u2018As I say, \neven if You-Know-Who has gone \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can \ncall him by his name? All this \u201cYou-Know-Who\u201d nonsense \u2013 for \neleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by \nhis proper name: Voldemort.\u2019 Professor McGonagall flinched, but \nDumbledore, who was unsticking two sherbet lemons, seemed \nnot to notice. \u2018It all gets so confusing if we keep saying \u201cYou-\nKnow-Who\u201d.\u2019 I have never seen any reason to be frightened of \nsaying Voldemort\u2019s name.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I know you haven\u2019t,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall, sounding half-\nexasperated, half-admiring. \u2018But you\u2019re different. Everyone knows \nyou\u2019re the only one You-Know \u2013 oh, all right, Voldemort \u2013 was \nfrightened of.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You flatter me,\u2019 said Dumbledore calmly. \u2018Voldemort had \npowers I will never have.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Only because you\u2019re too \u2013 well \u2013 noble to use them.\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s lucky it\u2019s dark. I haven\u2019t blushed so much since Madam \n\nPomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and \n\nsaid, \u2018The owls are nothing to the rumours that are flying around. \nYou know what everyone\u2019s saying? About why he\u2019s disappeared? \nAbout what finally stopped him?\u2019 \n\nIt seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she \nwas most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting \non a cold hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman \nhad she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did \nnow. It was plain that whatever \u2018everyone\u2019 was saying, she was not \ngoing to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. \nDumbledore, however, was choosing another sherbet lemon and \ndid not answer. \n\n\u2018What they\u2019re saying,\u2019 she pressed on, \u2018is that last night Voldemort \nturned up in Godric\u2019s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The \nrumour is that Lily and James Potter are \u2013 are \u2013 that they\u2019re \u2013 \ndead.\u2019 \n\nDumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped. \n\u2018Lily and James ... I can\u2019t believe it ... I didn\u2019t want to believe it \n\n... Oh, Albus ...\u2019 \nDumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. \u2018I \n\n\n\n THE  BOY  WHO  LIVED 15 \n \n\n \n\nknow ... I know ...\u2019 he said heavily. \nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s voice trembled as she went on. \u2018That\u2019s \n\nnot all. They\u2019re saying he tried to kill the Potters\u2019 son, Harry. But \u2013 \nhe couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or \nhow, but they\u2019re saying that when he couldn\u2019t kill Harry Potter, \nVoldemort\u2019s power somehow broke \u2013 and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gone.\u2019 \n\nDumbledore nodded glumly. \n\u2018It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s true?\u2019 faltered Professor McGonagall. \u2018After all he\u2019s \n\ndone ... all the people he\u2019s killed ... he couldn\u2019t kill a little boy? It\u2019s \njust astounding ... of all the things to stop him ... but how in the \nname of heaven did Harry survive?\u2019 \n\n\u2018We can only guess,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018We may never know.\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and \n\ndabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a \ngreat sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined \nit. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; \ninstead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have \nmade sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his \npocket and said, \u2018Hagrid\u2019s late. I suppose it was he who told you \nI\u2019d be here, by the way?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall. \u2018And I don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re \ngoing to tell me why you\u2019re here, of all places?\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They\u2019re the \nonly family he has left now.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t mean \u2013 you can\u2019t mean the people who live here?\u2019 \ncried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at \nnumber four. \u2018Dumbledore \u2013 you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been watching them \nall day. You couldn\u2019t find two people who are less like us. And \nthey\u2019ve got this son \u2013 I saw him kicking his mother all the way up \nthe street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!\u2019 \n\n\u2018It\u2019s the best place for him,\u2019 said Dumbledore firmly. \u2018His aunt \nand uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he\u2019s \nolder. I\u2019ve written them a letter.\u2019 \n\n\u2018A letter?\u2019 repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back \ndown on the wall. \u2018Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain \nall this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He\u2019ll \nbe famous \u2013 a legend \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if today was \nknown as Harry Potter Day in future \u2013 there will be books written \nabout Harry \u2013 every child in our world will know his name!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top \n\n\n\n16 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nof his half-moon glasses. \u2018It would be enough to turn any boy\u2019s \nhead. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something \nhe won\u2019t even remember! Can\u2019t you see how much better off he\u2019ll \nbe, growing up away from all that until he\u2019s ready to take it?\u2019 \n\nProfessor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, \nswallowed and then said, \u2018Yes \u2013 yes, you\u2019re right, of course. But \nhow is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?\u2019 She eyed his cloak \nsuddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry \nunderneath it. \n\n\u2018Hagrid\u2019s bringing him.\u2019 \n\u2018You think it \u2013 wise \u2013 to trust Hagrid with something as impor-\n\ntant as this?\u2019 \n\u2018I would trust Hagrid with my life,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \n\u2018I\u2019m not saying his heart isn\u2019t in the right place,\u2019 said Professor \n\nMcGonagall grudgingly, \u2018but you can\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not careless. \nHe does tend to \u2013 what was that?\u2019 \n\nA low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It \ngrew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for \nsome sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked \nup at the sky \u2013 and a huge motorbike fell out of the air and landed \non the road in front of them. \n\nIf the motorbike was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting \nastride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least \nfive times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so \nwild \u2013 long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \nface, he had hands the size of dustbin lids and his feet in their \nleather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms \nhe was holding a bundle of blankets. \n\n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u2018At last. And \nwhere did you get that motorbike?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,\u2019 said the giant, climbing \ncarefully off the motorbike as he spoke. \u2018Young Sirius Black lent it \nme. I\u2019ve got him, sir.\u2019 \n\n\u2018No problems, were there?\u2019 \n\u2018No, sir \u2013 house was almost destroyed but I got him out all \n\nright before the Muggles started swarmin\u2019 around. He fell asleep \nas we was flyin\u2019 over Bristol.\u2019 \n\nDumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the \nbundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. \nUnder a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a \n\n\n\n THE  BOY  WHO  LIVED 17 \n \n\n \n\ncuriously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning. \n\u2018Is that where \u2013?\u2019 whispered Professor McGonagall. \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018He\u2019ll have that scar for ever.\u2019 \n\u2018Couldn\u2019t you do something about it, Dumbledore?\u2019 \n\u2018Even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t. Scars can come in useful. I have \n\none myself above my left knee which is a perfect map of the \nLondon Underground. Well \u2013 give him here, Hagrid \u2013 we\u2019d better \nget this over with.\u2019 \n\nDumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned towards the \nDursleys\u2019 house. \n\n\u2018Could I \u2013 could I say goodbye to him, sir?\u2019 asked Hagrid. \nHe bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what \n\nmust have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, \nHagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog. \n\n\u2018Shhh!\u2019 hissed Professor McGonagall. \u2018You\u2019ll wake the Muggles!\u2019 \n\u2018S-s-sorry,\u2019 sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large spotted handker-\n\nchief and burying his face in it. \u2018But I c-c-can\u2019t stand it \u2013 Lily an\u2019 \nJames dead \u2013 an\u2019 poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes, yes, it\u2019s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or \nwe\u2019ll be found,\u2019 Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid \ngingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden \nwall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the \ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s \nblankets and then came back to the other two. For a full minute \nthe three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid\u2019s \nshoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously and the \ntwinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed \nto have gone out. \n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 said Dumbledore finally, \u2018that\u2019s that. We\u2019ve no business \nstaying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Hagrid in a very muffled voice. \u2018I\u2019d best get \nthis bike away. G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall \u2013 Professor \nDumbledore, sir.\u2019 \n\nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung \nhimself on to the motorbike and kicked the engine into life; with \na roar it rose into the air and off into the night. \n\n\u2018I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,\u2019 said \nDumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose \nin reply. \n\nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the \n\n\n\n18 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ncorner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it \nonce and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so \nthat Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out \na tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the \nstreet. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of \nnumber four. \n\n\u2018Good luck, Harry,\u2019 he murmured. He turned on his heel and \nwith a swish of his cloak he was gone. \n\nA breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay \nsilent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would \nexpect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over \ninside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on \nthe letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, \nnot knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in \na few hours\u2019 time by Mrs Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front \ndoor to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next \nfew weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley ... He \ncouldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret \nall over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in \nhushed voices: \u2018To Harry Potter \u2013 the boy who lived!\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER TWO \u2014 \n \n\nThe Vanishing Glass \n \n\nNearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to \nfind their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly \nchanged at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit \nup the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; it crept into \ntheir living-room, which was almost exactly the same as it had \nbeen on the night when Mr Dursley had seen that fateful news \nreport about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece \nreally showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there \nhad been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach \nball wearing different-coloured bobble hats \u2013 but Dudley Dursley \nwas no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large, \nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a roundabout at the fair, \nplaying a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed \nby his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived \nin the house, too. \n\nYet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not \nfor long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice \nwhich made the first noise of the day. \n\n\u2018Up! Get up! Now!\u2019 \nHarry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again. \n\u2018Up!\u2019 she screeched. Harry heard her walking towards the \n\nkitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the \ncooker. He rolled on to his back and tried to remember the dream \nhe had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a \nflying motorbike in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same \ndream before. \n\nHis aunt was back outside the door. \n\u2018Are you up yet?\u2019 she demanded. \n\u2018Nearly,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And \n\n\n\n20 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ndon\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s \nbirthday.\u2019 \n\nHarry groaned. \n\u2018What did you say?\u2019 his aunt snapped through the door. \n\u2018Nothing, nothing ...\u2019 \nDudley\u2019s birthday \u2013 how could he have forgotten? Harry got \n\nslowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair \nunder his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them \non. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \nstairs was full of them, and that was where he slept. \n\nWhen he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. \nThe table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday pres-\nents. It looked as though Dudley had got the new computer he \nwanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. \nExactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, \nas Dudley was very fat and hated exercise \u2013 unless of course it \ninvolved punching somebody. Dudley\u2019s favourite punch-bag was \nHarry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch him. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he \nwas very fast. \n\nPerhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard, \nbut Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He \nlooked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he \nhad to wear were old clothes of Dudley\u2019s and Dudley was about \nfour times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly \nknees, black hair and bright-green eyes. He wore round glasses \nheld together with a lot of Sellotape because of all the times \nDudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked \nabout his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead \nwhich was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as \nhe could remember and the first question he could ever remember \nasking his Aunt Petunia was how he had got it. \n\n\u2018In the car crash when your parents died,\u2019 she had said. \u2018And \ndon\u2019t ask questions.\u2019 \n\nDon\u2019t ask questions \u2013 that was the first rule for a quiet life with \nthe Dursleys. \n\nUncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over \nthe bacon. \n\n\u2018Comb your hair!\u2019 he barked, by way of a morning greeting. \nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his \n\nnewspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must \n\n\n\n THE  VANISHING  GLASS 21 \n \n\n \n\nhave had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put \ntogether, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way \n\u2013 all over the place. \n\nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen \nwith his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a \nlarge, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and \nthick, blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt \nPetunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel \u2013 Harry \noften said that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. \n\nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was \ndifficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was \ncounting his presents. His face fell. \n\n\u2018Thirty-six,\u2019 he said, looking up at his mother and father. \u2018That\u2019s \ntwo less than last year.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Darling, you haven\u2019t counted Auntie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s \nhere under this big one from Mummy and Daddy.\u2019 \n\n\u2018All right, thirty-seven then,\u2019 said Dudley, going red in the face. \nHarry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began \nwolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned \nthe table over. \n\nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger too, because she said \nquickly, \u2018And we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out \ntoday. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u2019 \n\nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally \nhe said slowly, \u2018So I\u2019ll have thirty ... thirty ...\u201d \n\n\u2018Thirty-nine, sweetums,\u2019 said Aunt Petunia. \n\u2018Oh.\u2019 Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \n\nAll right then.\u2019 \nUncle Vernon chuckled. \n\u2018Little tyke wants his money\u2019s worth, just like his father. Atta \n\nboy, Dudley!\u2019 He ruffled Dudley\u2019s hair. \nAt that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to \n\nanswer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap \nthe racing bike, a cine-camera, a remote-control aeroplane, sixteen \nnew computer games and a video recorder. He was ripping the \npaper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from \nthe telephone, looking both angry and worried. \n\n\u2018Bad news, Vernon,\u2019 she said. \u2018Mrs Figg\u2019s broken her leg. She \ncan\u2019t take him.\u2019 She jerked her head in Harry\u2019s direction. \n\nDudley\u2019s mouth fell open in horror but Harry\u2019s heart gave a \n\n\n\n22 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nleap. Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday his parents took him and a \nfriend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger bars or the \ncinema. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs Figg, a mad \nold lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The \nwhole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs Figg made him look at \nphotographs of all the cats she\u2019d ever owned. \n\n\u2018Now what?\u2019 said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as \nthough he\u2019d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that \nMrs Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn\u2019t easy when he reminded \nhimself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, \nSnowy, Mr Paws and Tufty again. \n\n\u2018We could phone Marge,\u2019 Uncle Vernon suggested. \n\u2018Don\u2019t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.\u2019 \nThe Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he \n\nwasn\u2019t there \u2013 or rather, as though he was something very nasty \nthat couldn\u2019t understand them, like a slug. \n\n\u2018What about what\u2019s-her-name, your friend \u2013 Yvonne?\u2019 \n\u2018On holiday in Majorca,\u2019 snapped Aunt Petunia. \n\u2018You could just leave me here,\u2019 Harry put in hopefully (he\u2019d be \n\nable to watch what he wanted on television for a change and \nmaybe even have a go on Dudley\u2019s computer). \n\nAunt Petunia looked as though she\u2019d just swallowed a lemon. \n\u2018And come back and find the house in ruins?\u2019 she snarled. \n\u2018I won\u2019t blow up the house,\u2019 said Harry, but they weren\u2019t listening. \n\u2018I suppose we could take him to the zoo,\u2019 said Aunt Petunia \n\nslowly, \u2018... and leave him in the car ...\u2019 \n\u2018That car\u2019s new, he\u2019s not sitting in it alone ...\u2019 \nDudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn\u2019t really crying, it \n\nhad been years since he\u2019d really cried, but he knew that if he \nscrewed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him \nanything he wanted. \n\n\u2018Dinky Duddydums, don\u2019t cry, Mummy won\u2019t let him spoil your \nspecial day!\u2019 she cried, flinging her arms around him. \n\n\u2018I ... don\u2019t ... want ... him ... t-t-to come!\u2019 Dudley yelled between \nhuge pretend sobs. \u2018He always sp-spoils everything!\u2019 He shot \nHarry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother\u2019s arms. \n\nJust then, the doorbell rang \u2013 \u2018Oh, Good Lord, they\u2019re here!\u2019 \nsaid Aunt Petunia frantically \u2013 and a moment later, Dudley\u2019s best \nfriend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a \nscrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who \n\n\n\n THE  VANISHING  GLASS 23 \n \n\n \n\nheld people\u2019s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. \nDudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \n\nHalf an hour later, Harry, who couldn\u2019t believe his luck, was \nsitting in the back of the Dursleys\u2019 car with Piers and Dudley, on \nthe way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle \nhadn\u2019t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but \nbefore they\u2019d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m warning you,\u2019 he had said, putting his large purple face \nright up close to Harry\u2019s, \u2018I\u2019m warning you now, boy \u2013 any funny \nbusiness, anything at all \u2013 and you\u2019ll be in that cupboard from \nnow until Christmas.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019m not going to do anything,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018honestly ...\u2019 \nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t believe him. No one ever did. \nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry \n\nand it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them \nhappen. \n\nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the bar-\nber\u2019s looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of \nkitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald \nexcept for his fringe, which she left \u2018to hide that horrible scar\u2019. \nDudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless \nnight imagining school the next day, where he was already \nlaughed at for his baggy clothes and Sellotaped glasses. Next \nmorning, however, he had got up to find his hair exactly as it had \nbeen before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a \nweek in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain \nthat he couldn\u2019t explain how it had grown back so quickly. \n\nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a \nrevolting old jumper of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange bobbles). \nThe harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed \nto become, until finally it might have fitted a glove puppet, but \ncertainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must \nhave shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t \npunished. \n\nOn the other hand, he\u2019d got into terrible trouble for being \nfound on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been \nchasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone \nelse\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had \nreceived a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them \nHarry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do \n\n\n\n24 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n(as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his \ncupboard) was jump behind the big bins outside the kitchen \ndoors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in \nmid-jump. \n\nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth \nbeing with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere \nthat wasn\u2019t school, his cupboard or Mrs Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling \nliving-room. \n\nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. \nHe liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the \ncouncil, Harry, the bank and Harry were just a few of his favourite \nsubjects. This morning, it was motorbikes. \n\n\u2018... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\u2019 he said, \nas a motorbike overtook them. \n\n\u2018I had a dream about a motorbike,\u2019 said Harry, remembering \nsuddenly. \u2018It was flying.\u2019 \n\nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned \nright around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic \nbeetroot with a moustache, \u2018MOTORBIKES DON\u2019T FLY!\u2019 \n\nDudley and Piers sniggered. \n\u2018I know they don\u2019t,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018It was only a dream.\u2019 \nBut he wished he hadn\u2019t said anything. If there was one thing \n\nthe Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his \ntalking about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it \nwas in a dream or even a cartoon \u2013 they seemed to think he might \nget dangerous ideas. \n\nIt was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with \nfamilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate \nice-creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in \nthe van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry \nhim away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice lolly. It wasn\u2019t bad \neither, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratch-\ning its head and looking remarkably like Dudley, except that it \nwasn\u2019t blond. \n\nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was \ncareful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley \nand Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by \nlunch-time, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favourite hobby of hitting \nhim. They ate in the zoo restaurant and when Dudley had a \ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory wasn\u2019t big enough, \n\n\n\n THE  VANISHING  GLASS 25 \n \n\n \n\nUncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to \nfinish the first. \n\nHarry felt, afterwards, that he should have known it was all too \ngood to last. \n\nAfter lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark \nin here, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all \nsorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits \nof wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poison-\nous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly \nfound the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its \nbody twice around Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crushed it into a dust-\nbin \u2013 but at the moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was \nfast asleep. \n\nDudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at \nthe glistening brown coils. \n\n\u2018Make it move,\u2019 he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped \non the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge. \n\n\u2018Do it again,\u2019 Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass \nsmartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \n\n\u2018This is boring,\u2019 Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the \n\nsnake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it had died of boredom \nitself \u2013 no company except stupid people drumming their fingers \non the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than \nhaving a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt \nPetunia hammering on the door to wake you up \u2013 at least he got to \nvisit the rest of the house. \n\nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, \nit raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s. \n\nIt winked. \nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone \n\nwas watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and \nwinked, too. \n\nThe snake jerked its head towards Uncle Vernon and Dudley, \nthen raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said \nquite plainly: \u2018I get that all the time.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I know,\u2019 Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn\u2019t \nsure the snake could hear him. \u2018It must be really annoying.\u2019 \n\nThe snake nodded vigorously. \n\u2018Where do you come from, anyway?\u2019 Harry asked. \n\n\n\n26 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nThe snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry \npeered at it. \n\nBoa Constrictor, Brazil. \n\u2018Was it nice there?\u2019 \nThe boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry \n\nread on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. \u2018Oh, I see \u2013 so you\u2019ve \nnever been to Brazil?\u2019 \n\nAs the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry \nmade both of them jump. \u2018DUDLEY! MR DURSLEY! COME AND \nLOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE WHAT IT\u2019S \nDOING!\u2019 \n\nDudley came waddling towards them as fast as he could. \n\u2018Out of the way, you,\u2019 he said, punching Harry in the ribs. \n\nCaught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What \ncame next happened so fast no one saw how it happened \u2013 one \nsecond, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, \nthe next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \n\nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s \ntank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, \nslithering out on to the floor \u2013 people throughout the reptile \nhouse screamed and started running for the exits. \n\nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a \nlow, hissing voice said, \u2018Brazil, here I come ... Thanksss, amigo.\u2019 \n\nThe keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \n\u2018But the glass,\u2019 he kept saying, \u2018where did the glass go?\u2019 \nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong \n\nsweet tea while he apologised over and over again. Piers and \nDudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake \nhadn\u2019t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it \npassed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, \nDudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while \nPiers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst \nof all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, \n\u2018Harry was talking to it, weren\u2019t you, Harry?\u2019 \n\nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house \nbefore starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. \nHe managed to say, \u2018Go \u2013 cupboard \u2013 stay \u2013 no meals,\u2019 before he \ncollapsed into a chair and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a \nlarge brandy. \n\n* \n\n\n\n THE  VANISHING  GLASS 27 \n \n\n \n\nHarry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. \nHe didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the \nDursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking \nto the kitchen for some food. \n\nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable \nyears, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby \nand his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember \nbeing in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he \nstrained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came \nup with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a \nburning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, \nthough he couldn\u2019t imagine where all the green light came from. \nHe couldn\u2019t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never \nspoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask \nquestions. There were no photographs of them in the house. \n\nWhen he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed \nof some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had \nnever happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes \nhe thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed \nto know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in \na violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with \nAunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew \nthe man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without \nbuying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green \nhad waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very \nlong purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the \nother day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest \nthing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish \nthe second Harry tried to get a closer look. \n\nAt school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley\u2019s \ngang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and \nbroken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley\u2019s gang. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER THREE \u2014 \n \n\nThe Letters from No One \n \n\nThe escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his \nlongest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his \ncupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had \nalready broken his new cine-camera, crashed his remote-control \naeroplane and, first time on his racing bike, knocked down old \nMrs Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches. \n\nHarry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping \nDudley\u2019s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, \nDennis, Malcolm and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as \nDudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. \nThe rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley\u2019s favourite \nsport: Harry-hunting. \n\nThis was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the \nhouse, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holi-\ndays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September \ncame he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first \ntime in his life, he wouldn\u2019t be with Dudley. Dudley had a place at \nUncle Vernon\u2019s old school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going \nthere, too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, \nthe local comprehensive. Dudley thought this was very funny. \n\n\u2018They stuff people\u2019s heads down the toilet first day at \nStonewall,\u2019 he told Harry. \u2018Want to come upstairs and practise?\u2019 \n\n\u2018No thanks,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018The poor toilet\u2019s never had anything as \nhorrible as your head down it \u2013 it might be sick.\u2019 Then he ran, \nbefore Dudley could work out what he\u2019d said. \n\nOne day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy \nhis Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs Figg\u2019s. Mrs Figg \nwasn\u2019t as bad as usual. It turned out she\u2019d broken her leg tripping \nover one of her cats and she didn\u2019t seem quite as fond of them \nas before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of \n\n\n\n THE  LETTERS  FROM  NO  ONE 29 \n \n\n \n\nchocolate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it for several years. \nThat evening, Dudley paraded around the living-room for the \n\nfamily in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon \ntailcoats, orange knickerbockers and flat straw hats called boaters. \nThey also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while \nthe teachers weren\u2019t looking. This was supposed to be good training \nfor later life. \n\nAs he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle \nVernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. \nAunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn\u2019t believe it was \nher Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. \nHarry didn\u2019t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs \nmight already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \n\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitchen next morning when \nHarry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large \nmetal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of \nwhat looked like dirty rags swimming in grey water. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they \nalways did if he dared to ask a question. \n\n\u2018Your new school uniform,\u2019 she said. \nHarry looked in the bowl again. \n\u2018Oh,\u2019 he said. \u2018I didn\u2019t realise it had to be so wet.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid,\u2019 snapped Aunt Petunia. \u2018I\u2019m dyeing some of \n\nDudley\u2019s old things grey for you. It\u2019ll look just like everyone else\u2019s \nwhen I\u2019ve finished.\u2019 \n\nHarry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. \nHe sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was \ngoing to look on his first day at Stonewall High \u2013 like he was \nwearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. \n\nDudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses \nbecause of the smell from Harry\u2019s new uniform. Uncle Vernon \nopened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smeltings \nstick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. \n\nThey heard the click of the letter-box and flop of letters on the \ndoormat. \n\n\u2018Get the post, Dudley,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon from behind his \npaper. \n\n\u2018Make Harry get it.\u2019 \n\u2018Get the post, Harry.\u2019 \n\u2018Make Dudley get it.\u2019 \n\n\n\n30 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Poke him with your Smeltings stick, Dudley.\u2019 \nHarry dodged the Smeltings stick and went to get the post. \n\nThree things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon\u2019s \nsister Marge, who was holidaying on the Isle of Wight, a brown \nenvelope that looked like a bill and \u2013 a letter for Harry. \n\nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a \ngiant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to \nhim. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives \u2013 he \ndidn\u2019t belong to the library so he\u2019d never even got rude notes \nasking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so \nplainly there could be no mistake: \n\n \nMr H. Potter \nThe Cupboard under the Stairs \n4 Privet Drive \nLittle Whinging \nSurrey \n\n \nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, \nand the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no \nstamp. \n\nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a \npurple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger \nand a snake surrounding a large letter \u2018H\u2019. \n\n\u2018Hurry up, boy!\u2019 shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. \u2018What \nare you doing, checking for letter-bombs?\u2019 He chuckled at his own \njoke. \n\nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He \nhanded Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down and \nslowly began to open the yellow envelope. \n\nUncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust and \nflipped over the postcard. \n\n\u2018Marge\u2019s ill,\u2019 he informed Aunt Petunia. \u2018Ate a funny whelk ...\u2019 \n\u2018Dad!\u2019 said Dudley suddenly. \u2018Dad, Harry\u2019s got something!\u2019 \nHarry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was writ-\n\nten on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was \njerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s mine!\u2019 said Harry, trying to snatch it back. \n\u2018Who\u2019d be writing to you?\u2019 sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the \n\nletter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from \n\n\n\n THE  LETTERS  FROM  NO  ONE 31 \n \n\n \n\nred to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop \nthere. Within seconds it was the greyish white of old porridge. \n\n\u2018P-P-Petunia!\u2019 he gasped. \nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held \n\nit high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read \nthe first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. \nShe clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \n\n\u2018Vernon! Oh my goodness \u2013 Vernon!\u2019 \nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry \n\nand Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being \nignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his \nSmeltings stick. \n\n\u2018I want to read that letter,\u2019 he said loudly. \n\u2018I want to read it,\u2019 said Harry furiously, \u2018as it\u2019s mine.\u2019 \n\u2018Get out, both of you,\u2019 croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter \n\nback inside its envelope. \nHarry didn\u2019t move. \n\u2018I WANT MY LETTER!\u2019 he shouted. \n\u2018Let me see it!\u2019 demanded Dudley. \n\u2018OUT!\u2019 roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and \n\nDudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, \nslamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley \npromptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at \nthe keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one \near, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and \nfloor. \n\n\u2018Vernon,\u2019 Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, \u2018look at \nthe address \u2013 how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You \ndon\u2019t think they\u2019re watching the house?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Watching \u2013 spying \u2013 might be following us,\u2019 muttered Uncle \nVernon wildly. \n\n\u2018But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell \nthem we don\u2019t want \u2013\u2019 \n\nHarry could see Uncle Vernon\u2019s shiny black shoes pacing up \nand down the kitchen. \n\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said finally. \u2018No, we\u2019ll ignore it. If they don\u2019t get an \nanswer ... yes, that\u2019s best ... we won\u2019t do anything ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018But \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn\u2019t we swear \n\nwhen we took him in we\u2019d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?\u2019 \n\n\n\n32 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nThat evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did \nsomething he\u2019d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard. \n\n\u2018Where\u2019s my letter?\u2019 said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had \nsqueezed through the door. \u2018Who\u2019s writing to me?\u2019 \n\n\u2018No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,\u2019 said Uncle \nVernon shortly. \u2018I have burned it.\u2019 \n\n\u2018It was not a mistake,\u2019 said Harry angrily. \u2018It had my cupboard \non it.\u2019 \n\n\u2018SILENCE!\u2019 yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell \nfrom the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his \nface into a smile, which looked quite painful. \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 yes, Harry \u2013 about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have \nbeen thinking ... you\u2019re really getting a bit big for it ... we think it \nmight be nice if you moved into Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Don\u2019t ask questions!\u2019 snapped his uncle. \u2018Take this stuff \n\nupstairs, now.\u2019 \nThe Dursleys\u2019 house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon \n\nand Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister, \nMarge), one where Dudley slept and one where Dudley kept all \nthe toys and things that wouldn\u2019t fit into his first bedroom. It only \ntook Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from \nthe cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared \naround him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-\nold cine-camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley \nhad once driven over next door\u2019s dog; in the corner was Dudley\u2019s \nfirst-ever television set, which he\u2019d put his foot through when his \nfavourite programme had been cancelled; there was a large bird-\ncage which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at \nschool for a real air-rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all \nbent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of \nbooks. They were the only things in the room that looked as \nthough they\u2019d never been touched. \n\nFrom downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his \nmother: \u2018I don\u2019t want him in there ... I need that room ... make him \nget out ...\u2019 \n\nHarry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he\u2019d have \ngiven anything to be up here. Today he\u2019d rather be back in his \ncupboard with that letter than up here without it. \n\nNext morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was \n\n\n\n THE  LETTERS  FROM  NO  ONE 33 \n \n\n \n\nin shock. He\u2019d screamed, whacked his father with his Smeltings \nstick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother and thrown his \ntortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still didn\u2019t have his \nroom back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and \nbitterly wishing he\u2019d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon \nand Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly. \n\nWhen the post arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying \nto be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him \nbanging things with his Smeltings stick all the way down the hall. \nThen he shouted, \u2018There\u2019s another one! Mr H. Potter, The Smallest \nBedroom, 4 Privet Drive \u2013\u2019 \n\nWith a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran \ndown the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to \nwrestle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which \nwas made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle \nVernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused \nfighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smeltings stick, \nUncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry\u2019s \nletter clutched in his hand. \n\n\u2018Go to your cupboard \u2013 I mean, your bedroom,\u2019 he wheezed at \nHarry. \u2018Dudley \u2013 go \u2013 just go.\u2019 \n\nHarry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew \nhe had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he \nhadn\u2019t received his first letter. Surely that meant they\u2019d try again? \nAnd this time he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t fail. He had a plan. \n\n* \nThe repaired alarm clock rang at six o\u2019clock the next morning. \nHarry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn\u2019t wake \nthe Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the \nlights. \n\nHe was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet \nDrive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered \nas he crept across the dark hall towards the front door \u2013 \n\n\u2018AAAAARRRGH!\u2019 \nHarry leapt into the air \u2013 he\u2019d trodden on something big and \n\nsquashy on the doormat \u2013 something alive! \nLights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realised that \n\nthe big squashy something had been his uncle\u2019s face. Uncle \nVernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping \nbag, clearly making sure that Harry didn\u2019t do exactly what he\u2019d \n\n\n\n34 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nbeen trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and \nthen told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miser-\nably off into the kitchen, and by the time he got back, the post \nhad arrived, right into Uncle Vernon\u2019s lap. Harry could see three \nletters addressed in green ink. \n\n\u2018I want \u2013\u2019 he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters \ninto pieces before his eyes. \n\nUncle Vernon didn\u2019t go to work that day. He stayed at home \nand nailed up the letter-box. \n\n\u2018See,\u2019 he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, \n\u2018if they can\u2019t deliver them they\u2019ll just give up.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll work, Vernon.\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, these people\u2019s minds work in strange ways, Petunia, \n\nthey\u2019re not like you and me,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock \nin a nail with the piece of fruit cake Aunt Petunia had just \nbrought him. \n\n* \nOn Friday, no fewer than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they \ncouldn\u2019t go through the letter-box they had been pushed under \nthe door, slotted through the sides and a few even forced through \nthe small window in the downstairs toilet. \n\nUncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, \nhe got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around \nthe front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed \n\u2018Tiptoe through the Tulips\u2019 as he worked, and jumped at small \nnoises. \n\n* \nOn Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters \nto Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden \ninside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milk-\nman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living-room window. \nWhile Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post \noffice and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt \nPetunia shredded the letters in her food mixer. \n\n\u2018Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?\u2019 Dudley asked \nHarry in amazement. \n\n* \nOn Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table \nlooking tired and rather ill, but happy. \n\n\u2018No post on Sundays,\u2019 he reminded them happily as he spread \n\n\n\n THE  LETTERS  FROM  NO  ONE 35 \n \n\n \n\nmarmalade on his newspapers, \u2018no damn letters today \u2013\u2019 \nSomething came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he \n\nspoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next \nmoment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace \nlike bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air \ntrying to catch one \u2013 \n\n\u2018Out! OUT!\u2019 \nUncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him \n\ninto the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with \ntheir arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. \nThey could hear the letters still streaming into the room, \nbouncing off the walls and floor. \n\n\u2018That does it,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but \npulling great tufts out of his moustache at the same time. \u2018I want \nyou all back here in five minutes, ready to leave. We\u2019re going \naway. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!\u2019 \n\nHe looked so dangerous with half his moustache missing that \nno one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their \nway through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding \ntowards the motorway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; \nhis father had hit him round the head for holding them up while \nhe tried to pack his television, video and computer in his sports \nbag. \n\nThey drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t dare ask \nwhere they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would \ntake a sharp turning and drive in the opposite direction for a \nwhile. \n\n\u2018Shake \u2019em off ... shake \u2019em off,\u2019 he would mutter whenever he \ndid this. \n\nThey didn\u2019t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was \nhowling. He\u2019d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, \nhe\u2019d missed five television programmes he\u2019d wanted to see and \nhe\u2019d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his \ncomputer. \n\nUncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel \non the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room \nwith twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry \nstayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights \nof passing cars and wondering ... \n\n* \n\n\n\n36 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nThey ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for \nbreakfast next day. They had just finished when the owner of the \nhotel came over to their table. \n\n\u2018 \u2019Scuse me, but is one of you Mr H. Potter? Only I got about an \n\u2019undred of these at the front desk.\u2019 \n\nShe held up a letter so they could read the green ink address: \n \n\nMr H. Potter \nRoom 17 \nRailview Hotel \nCokeworth \n\n \nHarry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his \nhand out of the way. The woman stared. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll take them,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and \nfollowing her from the dining-room. \n\n* \n\u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better just to go home, dear?\u2019 Aunt Petunia sug-\ngested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t seem to hear \nher. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He \ndrove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, \nshook his head, got back in the car and off they went again. The \nsame thing happened in the middle of a ploughed field, halfway \nacross a suspension bridge and at the top of a multi-storey car \npark. \n\n\u2018Daddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he?\u2019 Dudley asked Aunt Petunia \ndully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, \nlocked them all inside the car and disappeared. \n\nIt started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. \nDudley snivelled. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s Monday,\u2019 he told his mother. \u2018The Great Humberto\u2019s on \ntonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.\u2019 \n\nMonday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday \u2013\nand you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the \nweek, because of television \u2013 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry\u2019s \neleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun \n\u2013 last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat-hanger and a pair of \nUncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven every day. \n\nUncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carry-\ning a long, thin package and didn\u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she \n\n\n\n THE  LETTERS  FROM  NO  ONE 37 \n \n\n \n\nasked what he\u2019d bought. \n\u2018Found the perfect place!\u2019 he said. \u2018Come on! Everyone out!\u2019 \nIt was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at \n\nwhat looked like a large rock way out to sea. Perched on top of \nthe rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. \nOne thing was certain, there was no television in there. \n\n\u2018Storm forecast for tonight!\u2019 said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping \nhis hands together. \u2018And this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to lend us \nhis boat!\u2019 \n\nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a \nrather wicked grin, at an old rowing boat bobbing in the iron-grey \nwater below them. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, \u2018so all \naboard!\u2019 \n\nIt was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down \ntheir necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what \nseemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, \nslipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house. \n\nThe inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the \nwind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls and the fire-\nplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms. \n\nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a packet of crisps each \nand four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty crisp packets \njust smoked and shrivelled up. \n\n\u2018Could do with some of those letters now, eh?\u2019 he said cheer-\nfully. \n\nHe was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody \nstood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver post. \nHarry privately agreed, though the thought didn\u2019t cheer him up at \nall. \n\nAs night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray \nfrom the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce \nwind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few \nmouldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for \nDudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to \nthe lumpy bed next door and Harry was left to find the softest bit \nof floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged \nblanket. \n\nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went \non. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to \n\n\n\n38 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nget comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s \nsnores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near \nmidnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling \nover the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven \nin ten minutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, \nwondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering \nwhere the letter-writer was now. \n\nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He \nhoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be \nwarmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet \nDrive would be so full of letters when they got back that he\u2019d be \nable to steal one somehow. \n\nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the \nrock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny \ncrunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? \n\nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds ... twenty \n... ten \u2013 nine \u2013 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \u2013\nthree \u2013 two \u2013 one \u2013 \n\nBOOM. \nThe whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at \n\nthe door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER FOUR \u2014 \n \n\nThe Keeper of the Keys \n \n\nBOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \n\u2018Where\u2019s the cannon?\u2019 he said stupidly. \nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skid-\n\nding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands \u2013 now \nthey knew what had been in the long, thin package he had \nbrought with them. \n\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 he shouted. \u2018I warn you \u2013 I\u2019m armed!\u2019 \nThere was a pause. Then \u2013 \nSMASH! \nThe door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its \n\nhinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor. \nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was \n\nalmost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a \nwild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like \nblack beetles under all the hair. \n\nThe giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his \nhead just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door \nand fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm out-\nside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \n\n\u2018Couldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy \njourney ...\u2019 \n\nHe strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear. \n\u2018Budge up, yeh great lump,\u2019 said the stranger. \nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was \n\ncrouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \n\u2018An\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u2019 said the giant. \nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw \n\nthat the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \n\u2018Las\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u2019 said the giant. \u2018Yeh \n\nlook a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mum\u2019s eyes.\u2019 \n\n\n\n40 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \n\u2018I demand that you leave at once, sir!\u2019 he said. \u2018You are breaking \n\nand entering!\u2019 \n\u2018Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u2019 said the giant. He \n\nreached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle \nVernon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made \nof rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \n\nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being \ntrodden on. \n\n\u2018Anyway \u2013 Harry,\u2019 said the giant, turning his back on the \nDursleys, \u2018a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh here \n\u2013 I mighta sat on it at some point, but it\u2019ll taste all right.\u2019 \n\nFrom an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly \nsquashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was \na large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written \non it in green icing. \n\nHarry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but \nthe words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said \ninstead was, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 \n\nThe giant chuckled. \n\u2018True, I haven\u2019t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of \n\nKeys and Grounds at Hogwarts.\u2019 \nHe held out an enormous hand and shook Harry\u2019s whole arm. \n\u2018What about that tea then, eh?\u2019 he said, rubbing his hands \n\ntogether. \u2018I\u2019d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh\u2019ve got it, \nmind.\u2019 \n\nHis eyes fell on the empty grate with the shrivelled crisp pack-\nets in it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they \ncouldn\u2019t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second \nlater, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut \nwith flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as \nthough he\u2019d sunk into a hot bath. \n\nThe giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his \nweight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of \nhis coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a \nteapot, several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid \nwhich he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the \nhut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody \nsaid a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the \nfirst six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley \n\n\n\n THE  KEEPER  OF  THE  KEYS 41 \n \n\n \n\nfidgeted a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u2018Don\u2019t touch anything \nhe gives you, Dudley.\u2019 \n\nThe giant chuckled darkly. \n\u2018Yer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 any more, \n\nDursley, don\u2019 worry.\u2019 \nHe passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had \n\nnever tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his \neyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain any-\nthing, he said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, but I still don\u2019t really know who you are.\u2019 \n\nThe giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back \nof his hand. \n\n\u2018Call me Hagrid,\u2019 he said, \u2018everyone does. An\u2019 like I told yeh, \nI\u2019m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts \u2013 yeh\u2019ll know all about Hogwarts, \no\u2019 course.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 no,\u2019 said Harry. \nHagrid looked shocked. \n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 Harry said quickly. \n\u2018Sorry?\u2019 barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who \n\nshrank back into the shadows. \u2018It\u2019s them as should be sorry! I \nknew yeh weren\u2019t gettin\u2019 yer letters but I never thought yeh \nwouldn\u2019t even know abou\u2019 Hogwarts, fer cryin\u2019 out loud! Did yeh \nnever wonder where yer parents learnt it all?\u2019 \n\n\u2018All what?\u2019 asked Harry. \n\u2018ALL WHAT?\u2019 Hagrid thundered. \u2018Now wait jus\u2019 one second!\u2019 \nHe had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole \n\nhut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall. \n\u2018Do you mean ter tell me,\u2019 he growled at the Dursleys, \u2018that this \n\nboy \u2013 this boy! \u2013 knows nothin\u2019 abou\u2019 \u2013 about ANYTHING?\u2019 \nHarry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, \n\nafter all, and his marks weren\u2019t bad. \n\u2018I know some things,\u2019 he said. \u2018I can, you know, do maths and \n\nstuff.\u2019 \nBut Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, \u2018About our world, I \n\nmean. Your world. My world. Yer parents\u2019 world.\u2019 \n\u2018What world?\u2019 \nHagrid looked as if he was about to explode. \n\u2018DURSLEY!\u2019 he boomed. \nUncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something \n\nthat sounded like \u2018Mimblewimble\u2019. Hagrid stared wildly at Harry. \n\u2018But yeh must know about yer mum and dad,\u2019 he said. \u2018I mean, \n\n\n\n42 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nthey\u2019re famous. You\u2019re famous.\u2019 \n\u2018What? My \u2013 my mum and dad weren\u2019t famous, were they?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeh don\u2019 know ... yeh don\u2019 know ...\u2019 Hagrid ran his fingers \n\nthrough his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare. \n\u2018Yeh don\u2019 know what yeh are?\u2019 he said finally. \nUncle Vernon suddenly found his voice. \n\u2018Stop!\u2019 he commanded. \u2018Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell \n\nthe boy anything!\u2019 \nA braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under \n\nthe furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his \nevery syllable trembled with rage. \n\n\u2018You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter \nDumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, \nDursley! An\u2019 you\u2019ve kept it from him all these years?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Kept what from me?\u2019 said Harry eagerly. \n\u2018STOP! I FORBID YOU!\u2019 yelled Uncle Vernon in panic. \nAunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror. \n\u2018Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Harry \u2013 yer a \n\nwizard.\u2019 \nThere was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the \n\nwhistling wind could be heard. \n\u2018I\u2019m a what?\u2019 gasped Harry. \n\u2018A wizard, o\u2019 course,\u2019 said Hagrid, sitting back down on the \n\nsofa, which groaned and sank even lower, \u2018an\u2019 a thumpin\u2019 good\u2019un, \nI\u2019d say, once yeh\u2019ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an\u2019 dad like \nyours, what else would yeh be? An\u2019 I reckon it\u2019s abou\u2019 time yeh \nread yer letter.\u2019 \n\nHarry stretched out his hand at last to take the yellowish \nenvelope, addressed in emerald green to Mr H. Potter, The Floor, \nHut-on-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read: \n\n \nHOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY \n\n \nHeadmaster: Albus Dumbledore \n\n(Order of Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, \nSupreme Mugwump, International Confed. of Wizards) \n\n \nDear Mr Potter, \n\nWe are pleased to inform you that you have a place at \nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find \n\n\n\n THE  KEEPER  OF  THE  KEYS 43 \n \n\n \n\nenclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment. \nTerm begins on 1 September. We await your owl by no later \n\nthan 31 July. \n \n\nYours sincerely, \n \nMinerva McGonagall \nDeputy Headmistress \n \n\nQuestions exploded inside Harry\u2019s head like fireworks and he \ncouldn\u2019t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stam-\nmered, \u2018What does it mean, they await my owl?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Gallopin\u2019 Gorgons, that reminds me,\u2019 said Hagrid, clapping a \nhand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart \nhorse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled \nan owl \u2013 a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl \u2013 a long quill and \na roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scrib-\nbled a note which Harry could read upside-down: \n\n \nDear Mr Dumbledore, \n\nGiven Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. \nWeather\u2019s horrible. Hope you\u2019re well. \nHagrid \n \n\nHagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in \nits beak, went to the door and threw the owl out into the storm. \nThen he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as \ntalking on the telephone. \n\nHarry realised his mouth was open and closed it quickly. \n\u2018Where was I?\u2019 said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, \n\nstill ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. \n\u2018He\u2019s not going,\u2019 he said. \nHagrid grunted. \n\u2018I\u2019d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,\u2019 he said. \n\u2018A what?\u2019 said Harry, interested. \n\u2018A Muggle,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018It\u2019s what we call non-magic folk like \n\nthem. An\u2019 it\u2019s your bad luck you grew up in a family o\u2019 the biggest \nMuggles I ever laid eyes on.\u2019 \n\n\u2018We swore when we took him in we\u2019d put a stop to that \nrubbish,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, \u2018swore we\u2019d stamp it out of him! \n\n\n\n44 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nWizard, indeed!\u2019 \n\u2018You knew?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018You knew I\u2019m a \u2013 a wizard?\u2019 \n\u2018Knew!\u2019 shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. \u2018Knew! Of course we \n\nknew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she \nwas? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that \n\u2013 that school \u2013 and came home every holiday with her pockets full \nof frog-spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who \nsaw her for what she was \u2013 a freak! But for my mother and father, \noh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a \nwitch in the family!\u2019 \n\nShe stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It \nseemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. \n\n\u2018Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got mar-\nried and had you, and of course I knew you\u2019d be just the same, \njust as strange, just as \u2013 as \u2013 abnormal \u2013 and then, if you please, \nshe went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!\u2019 \n\nHarry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he \nsaid, \u2018Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!\u2019 \n\n\u2018CAR CRASH!\u2019 roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the \nDursleys scuttled back to their corner. \u2018How could a car crash kill \nLily an\u2019 James Potter? It\u2019s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not \nknowin\u2019 his own story when every kid in our world knows his \nname!\u2019 \n\n\u2018But why? What happened?\u2019 Harry asked urgently. \nThe anger faded from Hagrid\u2019s face. He looked suddenly \n\nanxious. \n\u2018I never expected this,\u2019 he said, in a low, worried voice. \u2018I had no \n\nidea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin\u2019 \nhold of yeh, how much yeh didn\u2019t know. Ah, Harry, I don\u2019 know if \nI\u2019m the right person ter tell yeh \u2013 but someone\u2019s gotta \u2013 yeh can\u2019t \ngo off ter Hogwarts not knowin\u2019.\u2019 \n\nHe threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. \n\u2018Well, it\u2019s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh \u2013 mind, I \n\ncan\u2019t tell yeh everythin\u2019, it\u2019s a great myst\u2019ry, parts of it ...\u2019 \nHe sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds and \n\nthen said, \u2018It begins, I suppose, with \u2013 with a person called \u2013 but \nit\u2019s incredible yeh don\u2019t know his name, everyone in our world \nknows \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Who?\u2019 \n\u2018Well \u2013 I don\u2019 like sayin\u2019 the name if I can help it. No one does.\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  KEEPER  OF  THE  KEYS 45 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019 \n\u2018Gulpin\u2019 gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is \n\ndifficult. See, there was this wizard who went ... bad. As bad as \nyou could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was ...\u2019 \n\nHagrid gulped, but no words came out. \n\u2018Could you write it down?\u2019 Harry suggested. \n\u2018Nah \u2013 can\u2019t spell it. All right \u2013 Voldemort.\u2019 Hagrid shuddered. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019 make me say it again. Anyway, this \u2013 this wizard, about \ntwenty years ago now, started lookin\u2019 fer followers. Got \u2019em, too \u2013\nsome were afraid, some just wanted a bit o\u2019 his power, \u2019cause he \nwas gettin\u2019 himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn\u2019t know \nwho ter trust, didn\u2019t dare get friendly with strange wizards or \nwitches ... Terrible things happened. He was takin\u2019 over. \u2019Course, \nsome stood up to him \u2013 an\u2019 he killed \u2019em. Horribly. One o\u2019 the \nonly safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore\u2019s the only \none You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn\u2019t dare try takin\u2019 the \nschool, not jus\u2019 then, anyway. \n\n\u2018Now, yer mum an\u2019 dad were as good a witch an\u2019 wizard as I \never knew. Head Boy an\u2019 Girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose \nthe myst\u2019ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get \u2019em on his \nside before ... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore \nter want anythin\u2019 ter do with the Dark Side. \n\n\u2018Maybe he thought he could persuade \u2019em ... maybe he just \nwanted \u2019em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in \nthe village where you was all living, on Hallowe\u2019en ten years ago. \nYou was just a year old. He came ter yer house an\u2019 \u2013 an\u2019 \u2013\u2019 \n\nHagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief \nand blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. \n\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he said. \u2018But it\u2019s that sad \u2013 knew yer mum an\u2019 dad, an\u2019 \nnicer people yeh couldn\u2019t find \u2013 anyway \u2013 \n\n\u2018You-Know-Who killed \u2019em. An\u2019 then \u2013 an\u2019 this is the real \nmyst\u2019ry of the thing \u2013 he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a \nclean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin\u2019 by then. \nBut he couldn\u2019t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on \nyer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That\u2019s what yeh get when \na powerful, evil curse touches yeh \u2013 took care of yer mum an\u2019 dad \nan\u2019 yer house, even \u2013 but it didn\u2019t work on you, an\u2019 that\u2019s why yer \nfamous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill \u2019em, no \none except you, an\u2019 he\u2019d killed some o\u2019 the best witches an\u2019 \nwizards of the age \u2013 the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts \u2013 an\u2019 \n\n\n\n46 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nyou was only a baby, an\u2019 you lived.\u2019 \nSomething very painful was going on in Harry\u2019s mind. As \n\nHagrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of \ngreen light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before \u2013\nand he remembered something else, for the first time in his life \u2013 a \nhigh, cold, cruel laugh. \n\nHagrid was watching him sadly. \n\u2018Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s \n\norders. Brought yeh ter this lot ...\u2019 \n\u2018Load of old tosh,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped, he had \n\nalmost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon \ncertainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at \nHagrid and his fists were clenched. \n\n\u2018Now, you listen here, boy,\u2019 he snarled. \u2018I accept there\u2019s some-\nthing strange about you, probably nothing a good beating \nwouldn\u2019t have cured \u2013 and as for all this about your parents, well, \nthey were weirdos, no denying it, and the world\u2019s better off with-\nout them in my opinion \u2013 asked for all they got, getting mixed up \nwith these wizarding types \u2013 just what I expected, always knew \nthey\u2019d come to a sticky end \u2013\u2019 \n\nBut at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a \nbattered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle \nVernon like a sword, he said, \u2018I\u2019m warning you, Dursley \u2013 I\u2019m \nwarning you \u2013 one more word ...\u2019 \n\nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a \nbearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s courage failed again; he flattened \nhimself against the wall and fell silent. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s better,\u2019 said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back \ndown on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. \n\nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \n\u2018But what happened to Vol\u2013 sorry \u2013 I mean, You-Know-Who?\u2019 \n\u2018Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he \n\ntried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest \nmyst\u2019ry, see ... he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful \u2013 why\u2019d he \ngo? \n\n\u2018Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had \nenough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, \nbidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his \nside came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. \nDon\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve done if he was comin\u2019 back. \n\n\n\n THE  KEEPER  OF  THE  KEYS 47 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Most of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his \npowers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you \nfinished him, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he \nhadn\u2019t counted on \u2013 I dunno what it was, no one does \u2013 but \nsomethin\u2019 about you stumped him, all right.\u2019 \n\nHagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his \neyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite \nsure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How \ncould he possibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley \nand bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a \nwizard, why hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time \nthey\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the \ngreatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been \nable to kick him around like a football? \n\n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018I think you must have made a mistake. \nI don\u2019t think I can be a wizard.\u2019 \n\nTo his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. \n\u2018Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was \n\nscared, or angry?\u2019 \nHarry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it ... \n\nevery odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious \nwith him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry \n... chased by Dudley\u2019s gang, he had somehow found himself out of \ntheir reach ... dreading going to school with that ridiculous hair-\ncut, he\u2019d managed to make it grow back ... and the very last time \nDudley had hit him, hadn\u2019t he got his revenge, without even real-\nising he was doing it? Hadn\u2019t he set a boa constrictor on him? \n\nHarry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was \npositively beaming at him. \n\n\u2018See?\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Harry Potter, not a wizard \u2013 you wait, you\u2019ll \nbe right famous at Hogwarts.\u2019 \n\nBut Uncle Vernon wasn\u2019t going to give in without a fight. \n\u2018Haven\u2019t I told you he\u2019s not going?\u2019 he hissed. \u2018He\u2019s going to \n\nStonewall High and he\u2019ll be grateful for it. I\u2019ve read those letters \nand he needs all sorts of rubbish \u2013 spell books and wands and \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won\u2019t stop him,\u2019 \ngrowled Hagrid. \u2018Stop Lily an\u2019 James Potter\u2019s son goin\u2019 ter \nHogwarts! Yer mad. His name\u2019s been down ever since he was \nborn. He\u2019s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in \nthe world. Seven years there and he won\u2019t know himself. He\u2019ll be \n\n\n\n48 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwith youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an\u2019 he\u2019ll be under the \ngreatest Headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled\u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO \nTEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!\u2019 yelled Uncle Vernon. \n\nBut he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and \nwhirled it over his head. \u2018NEVER \u2013\u2019 he thundered, \u2018\u2013 INSULT \u2013 \nALBUS \u2013 DUMBLEDORE \u2013 IN \u2013 FRONT \u2013 OF \u2013 ME!\u2019 \n\nHe brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to \npoint at Dudley \u2013 there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a \nfirecracker, a sharp squeal and next second, Dudley was dancing \non the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in \npain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig\u2019s \ntail poking through a hole in his trousers. \n\nUncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the \nother room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed \nthe door behind them. \n\nHagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. \n\u2018Shouldn\u2019ta lost me temper,\u2019 he said ruefully, \u2018but it didn\u2019t work \n\nanyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so \nmuch like a pig anyway there wasn\u2019t much left ter do.\u2019 \n\nHe cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. \n\u2018Be grateful if yeh didn\u2019t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,\u2019 \n\nhe said. \u2018I\u2019m \u2013 er \u2013 not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin\u2019. I \nwas allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an\u2019 get yer letters to yeh an\u2019 \nstuff \u2013 one o\u2019 the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why aren\u2019t you supposed to do magic?\u2019 asked Harry. \n\u2018Oh, well \u2013 I was at Hogwarts meself but I \u2013 er \u2013 got expelled, \n\nter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in \nhalf an\u2019 everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. \nGreat man, Dumbledore.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why were you expelled?\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s gettin\u2019 late and we\u2019ve got lots ter do tomorrow,\u2019 said Hagrid \n\nloudly. \u2018Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an\u2019 that.\u2019 \nHe took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. \n\u2018You can kip under that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019 mind if it wriggles a bit, \n\nI think I still got a couple o\u2019 dormice in one o\u2019 the pockets.\u2019 \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER FIVE \u2014 \n \n\nDiagon Alley \n \n\nHarry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was \ndaylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. \n\n\u2018It was a dream,\u2019 he told himself firmly. \u2018I dreamed a giant called \nHagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When \nI open my eyes I\u2019ll be at home in my cupboard.\u2019 \n\nThere was suddenly a loud tapping noise. \n\u2018And there\u2019s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,\u2019 Harry \n\nthought, his heart sinking. But he still didn\u2019t open his eyes. It had \nbeen such a good dream. \n\nTap. Tap. Tap. \n\u2018All right,\u2019 Harry mumbled, \u2018I\u2019m getting up.\u2019 \nHe sat up and Hagrid\u2019s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full \n\nof sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the \ncollapsed sofa and there was an owl rapping its claw on the \nwindow, a newspaper held in its beak. \n\nHarry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large \nballoon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window \nand jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the news-\npaper on top of Hagrid, who didn\u2019t wake up. The owl then \nfluttered on to the floor and began to attack Hagrid\u2019s coat. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t do that.\u2019 \nHarry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its \n\nbeak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. \n\u2018Hagrid!\u2019 said Harry loudly. \u2018There\u2019s an owl \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Pay him,\u2019 Hagrid grunted into the sofa. \n\u2018What?\u2019 \n\u2018He wants payin\u2019 fer deliverin\u2019 the paper. Look in the pockets.\u2019 \nHagrid\u2019s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets \u2013 \n\nbunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, mint humbugs, tea-\nbags ... finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. \n\n\n\n50 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Give him five Knuts,\u2019 said Hagrid sleepily. \n\u2018Knuts?\u2019 \n\u2018The little bronze ones.\u2019 \nHarry counted out five little bronze coins and the owl held out \n\nits leg so he could put the money into a small leather pouch tied \nto it. Then it flew off through the open window. \n\nHagrid yawned loudly, sat up and stretched. \n\u2018Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an\u2019 \n\nbuy all yer stuff fer school.\u2019 \nHarry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. \n\nHe had just thought of something which made him feel as though \nthe happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. \n\n\u2018Um \u2013 Hagrid?\u2019 \n\u2018Mm?\u2019 said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. \n\u2018I haven\u2019t got any money \u2013 and you heard Uncle Vernon last \n\nnight \u2013 he won\u2019t pay for me to go and learn magic.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about that,\u2019 said Hagrid, standing up and scratch-\n\ning his head. \u2018D\u2019yeh think yer parents didn\u2019t leave yeh anything?\u2019 \n\u2018But if their house was destroyed \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018They didn\u2019 keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop \n\nfer us is Gringotts. Wizards\u2019 bank. Have a sausage, they\u2019re not bad \ncold \u2013 an\u2019 I wouldn\u2019 say no teh a bit o\u2019 yer birthday cake, neither.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Wizards have banks?\u2019 \n\u2018Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.\u2019 \nHarry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. \n\u2018Goblins?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah \u2013 so yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it, I\u2019ll tell yeh that. Never \n\nmess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world \nfer anything yeh want ter keep safe \u2013 \u2019cept maybe Hogwarts. As a \nmatter o\u2019 fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. \nHogwarts business.\u2019 Hagrid drew himself up proudly. \u2018He usually \ngets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin\u2019 you \u2013 gettin\u2019 \nthings from Gringotts \u2013 knows he can trust me, see. \n\n\u2018Got everythin\u2019? Come on, then.\u2019 \nHarry followed Hagrid out on to the rock. The sky was quite \n\nclear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle \nVernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom \nafter the storm. \n\n\u2018How did you get here?\u2019 Harry asked, looking around for \nanother boat. \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 51 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Flew,\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\u2018Flew?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah \u2013 but we\u2019ll go back in this. Not s\u2019posed ter use magic \n\nnow I\u2019ve got yeh.\u2019 \nThey settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, \n\ntrying to imagine him flying. \n\u2018Seems a shame ter row, though,\u2019 said Hagrid, giving Harry \n\nanother of his sideways looks. \u2018If I was ter \u2013 er \u2013 speed things up a \nbit, would yeh mind not mentionin\u2019 it at Hogwarts?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid \npulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of \nthe boat and they sped off towards land. \n\n\u2018Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?\u2019 Harry asked. \n\u2018Spells \u2013 enchantments,\u2019 said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper \n\nas he spoke. \u2018They say there\u2019s dragons guardin\u2019 the high-security \nvaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way \u2013 Gringotts is hundreds of \nmiles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh\u2019d die \nof hunger tryin\u2019 ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer \nhands on summat.\u2019 \n\nHarry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his news-\npaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learnt from Uncle Vernon that \npeople liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very \ndifficult, he\u2019d never had so many questions in his life. \n\n\u2018Ministry o\u2019 Magic messin\u2019 things up as usual,\u2019 Hagrid muttered, \nturning the page. \n\n\u2018There\u2019s a Ministry of Magic?\u2019 Harry asked, before he could stop \nhimself. \n\n\u2018 \u2019Course,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, \no\u2019 course, but he\u2019d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge \ngot the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore \nwith owls every morning, askin\u2019 fer advice.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But what does a Ministry of Magic do?\u2019 \n\u2018Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there\u2019s \n\nstill witches an\u2019 wizards up an\u2019 down the country.\u2019 \n\u2018Why?\u2019 \n\u2018Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone\u2019d be wantin\u2019 magic solutions to \n\ntheir problems. Nah, we\u2019re best left alone.\u2019 \nAt this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbour wall. \n\nHagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone \nsteps on to the street. \n\n\n\n52 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nPassers-by stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the \nlittle town to the station. Harry couldn\u2019t blame them. Not only \nwas Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at per-\nfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, \u2018See \nthat, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, \u2018did you \nsay there are dragons at Gringotts?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Well, so they say,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Crikey, I\u2019d like a dragon.\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019d like one?\u2019 \n\u2018Wanted one ever since I was a kid \u2013 here we go.\u2019 \nThey had reached the station. There was a train to London in \n\nfive minutes\u2019 time. Hagrid, who didn\u2019t understand \u2018Muggle \nmoney\u2019, as he called it, gave the notes to Harry so he could buy \ntheir tickets. \n\nPeople stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two \nseats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. \n\n\u2018Still got yer letter, Harry?\u2019 he asked as he counted stitches. \nHarry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. \n\u2018Good,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018There\u2019s a list there of everything yeh need.\u2019 \nHarry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn\u2019t noticed the \n\nnight before and read: \n \n\nHOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY \n \n\nUniform \nFirst-year students will require: \n\n1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) \n2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear \n3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) \n4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) \n\nPlease note that all pupils\u2019 clothes should carry name tags \n \n\nSet Books \nAll students should have a copy of each of the following: \n\nThe Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk \nA History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot \nMagical Theory by Adalbert Waffling \nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch \nOne Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore \nMagical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 53 \n \n\n \n\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them by Newt Scamander \nThe Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection by Quentin Trimble \n \n\nOther Equipment \n1 wand \n1 cauldron (pewter, standard size 2) \n1 set glass or crystal phials \n1 telescope \n1 set brass scales \n \n\nStudents may also bring an owl OR a cat OR a toad \n \n\nPARENTS ARE REMINDED THAT FIRST-YEARS ARE NOT \nALLOWED THEIR OWN BROOMSTICKS \n \n\n\u2018Can we buy all this in London?\u2019 Harry wondered aloud. \n\u2018If yeh know where to go,\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\n* \nHarry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed \nto know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting \nthere in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the \nUnderground and complained loudly that the seats were too small \nand the trains too slow. \n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how the Muggles manage without magic,\u2019 he said, \nas they climbed a broken-down escalator which led up to a \nbustling road lined with shops. \n\nHagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry \nhad to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops \nand music stores, hamburger bars and cinemas, but nowhere that \nlooked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordi-\nnary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of \nwizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops \nthat sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some \nhuge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn\u2019t \nknown that the Dursleys had no sense of humour, he might have \nthought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told \nhim so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn\u2019t help trusting him. \n\n\u2018This is it,\u2019 said Hagrid, coming to a halt, \u2018the Leaky Cauldron. \nIt\u2019s a famous place.\u2019 \n\nIt was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn\u2019t pointed it \n\n\n\n54 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nout, Harry wouldn\u2019t have noticed it was there. The people hurry-\ning by didn\u2019t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop \non one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn\u2019t see \nthe Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar \nfeeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could \nmention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. \n\nFor a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old \nwomen were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. \nOne of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat \nwas talking to the old barman, who was quite bald and looked \nlike a gummy walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they \nwalked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and \nsmiled at him, and the barman reached for a glass, saying, \u2018The \nusual, Hagrid?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t, Tom, I\u2019m on Hogwarts business,\u2019 said Hagrid, clapping \nhis great hand on Harry\u2019s shoulder and making Harry\u2019s knees \nbuckle. \n\n\u2018Good Lord,\u2019 said the barman, peering at Harry, \u2018is this \u2013 can \nthis be \u2013?\u2019 \n\nThe Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and \nsilent. \n\n\u2018Bless my soul,\u2019 whispered the old barman. \u2018Harry Potter ... \nwhat an honour.\u2019 \n\nHe hurried out from behind the bar, rushed towards Harry and \nseized his hand, tears in his eyes. \n\n\u2018Welcome back, Mr Potter, welcome back.\u2019 \nHarry didn\u2019t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. \n\nThe old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realising \nit had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. \n\nThen there was a great scraping of chairs and, next moment, \nHarry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky \nCauldron. \n\n\u2018Doris Crockford, Mr Potter, can\u2019t believe I\u2019m meeting you at \nlast.\u2019 \n\n\u2018So proud, Mr Potter, I\u2019m just so proud.\u2019 \n\u2018Always wanted to shake your hand \u2013 I\u2019m all of a flutter.\u2019 \n\u2018Delighted, Mr Potter, just can\u2019t tell you. Diggle\u2019s the name, \n\nDedalus Diggle.\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019ve seen you before!\u2019 said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle\u2019s top hat fell \n\noff in his excitement. \u2018You bowed to me once in a shop.\u2019 \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 55 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018He remembers!\u2019 cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at every-\none. \u2018Did you hear that? He remembers me!\u2019 \n\nHarry shook hands again and again \u2013 Doris Crockford kept \ncoming back for more. \n\nA pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One \nof his eyes was twitching. \n\n\u2018Professor Quirrell!\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Harry, Professor Quirrell will \nbe one of your teachers at Hogwarts.\u2019 \n\n\u2018P-P-Potter,\u2019 stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry\u2019s \nhand, \u2018c-can\u2019t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?\u2019 \n\u2018D-Defence Against the D-D-Dark Arts,\u2019 muttered Professor \n\nQuirrell, as though he\u2019d rather not think about it. \u2018N-not that you \nn-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?\u2019 He laughed nervously. \u2018You\u2019ll be \ng-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I\u2019ve g-got to p-pick up \na new b-book on vampires, m-myself.\u2019 He looked terrified at \nthe very thought. \n\nBut the others wouldn\u2019t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to \nhimself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At \nlast, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. \n\n\u2018Must get on \u2013 lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.\u2019 \nDoris Crockford shook Harry\u2019s hand one last time and Hagrid \n\nled them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, \nwhere there was nothing but a dustbin and a few weeds. \n\nHagrid grinned at Harry. \n\u2018Told yeh, didn\u2019t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor \n\nQuirrell was tremblin\u2019 ter meet yeh \u2013 mind you, he\u2019s usually trem-\nblin\u2019.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Is he always that nervous?\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was \n\nstudyin\u2019 outta books but then he took a year off ter get some first-\nhand experience ... They say he met vampires in the Black Forest \nand there was a nasty bit o\u2019 trouble with a hag \u2013 never been the \nsame since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject \u2013 \nnow, where\u2019s me umbrella?\u2019 \n\nVampires? Hags? Harry\u2019s head was swimming. Hagrid, mean-\nwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the dustbin. \n\n\u2018Three up ... two across ...\u2019 he muttered. \u2018Right, stand back, Harry.\u2019 \nHe tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. \nThe brick he had touched quivered \u2013 it wriggled \u2013 in the middle, \n\n\n\n56 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\na small hole appeared \u2013 it grew wider and wider \u2013 a second later \nthey were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an arch-\nway on to a cobbled street which twisted and turned out of sight. \n\n\u2018Welcome,\u2019 said Hagrid, \u2018to Diagon Alley.\u2019 \nHe grinned at Harry\u2019s amazement. They stepped through the \n\narchway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the \narchway shrink instantly back into solid wall. \n\nThe sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the \nnearest shop. Cauldrons \u2013 All Sizes \u2013 Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver \u2013 \nSelf-Stirring \u2013 Collapsible said a sign hanging over them. \n\n\u2018Yeah, you\u2019ll be needin\u2019 one,\u2019 said Hagrid, \u2018but we gotta get yer \nmoney first.\u2019 \n\nHarry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head \nin every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at \neverything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people \ndoing their shopping. A plump woman outside an apothecary\u2019s \nwas shaking her head as they passed, saying, \u2018Dragon liver, sixteen \nSickles an ounce, they\u2019re mad ...\u2019 \n\nA low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying \nEeylops Owl Emporium \u2013 Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown and Snowy. \nSeveral boys of about Harry\u2019s age had their noses pressed against a \nwindow with broomsticks in it. \u2018Look,\u2019 Harry heard one of them \nsay, \u2018the new Nimbus Two Thousand \u2013 fastest ever \u2013\u2019 There were \nshops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver \ninstruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with \nbarrels of bat spleens and eels\u2019 eyes, tottering piles of spell books, \nquills and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon ... \n\n\u2018Gringotts,\u2019 said Hagrid. \nThey had reached a snowy-white building which towered over \n\nthe other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, \nwearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was \u2013 \n\n\u2018Yeah, that\u2019s a goblin,\u2019 said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the \nwhite stone steps towards him. The goblin was about a head \nshorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard \nand, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they \nwalked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver \nthis time, with words engraved upon them: \n\n \nEnter, stranger, but take heed \nOf what awaits the sin of greed, \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 57 \n \n\n \n\nFor those who take, but do not earn, \nMust pay most dearly in their turn, \nSo if you seek beneath our floors \nA treasure that was never yours, \nThief, you have been warned, beware \nOf finding more than treasure there. \n\n \n\u2018Like I said, yeh\u2019d be mad ter try an\u2019 rob it,\u2019 said Hagrid. \nA pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they \n\nwere in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were \nsitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large \nledgers, weighing coins on brass scales, examining precious stones \nthrough eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading \noff the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out \nof these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. \n\n\u2018Morning,\u2019 said Hagrid to a free goblin. \u2018We\u2019ve come ter take \nsome money outta Mr Harry Potter\u2019s safe.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You have his key, sir?\u2019 \n\u2018Got it here somewhere,\u2019 said Hagrid and he started emptying \n\nhis pockets on to the counter, scattering a handful of mouldy dog-\nbiscuits over the goblin\u2019s book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled \nhis nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile \nof rubies as big as glowing coals. \n\n\u2018Got it,\u2019 said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. \nThe goblin looked at it closely. \n\u2018That seems to be in order.\u2019 \n\u2018An\u2019 I\u2019ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,\u2019 said \n\nHagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. \u2018It\u2019s about the You-\nKnow-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.\u2019 \n\nThe goblin read the letter carefully. \n\u2018Very well,\u2019 he said, handing it back to Hagrid, \u2018I will have \n\nsomeone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!\u2019 \nGriphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed \n\nall the dog-biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry fol-\nlowed Griphook towards one of the doors leading off the hall. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thir-\nteen?\u2019 Harry asked. \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t tell yeh that,\u2019 said Hagrid mysteriously. \u2018Very secret. \nHogwarts business. Dumbledore\u2019s trusted me. More\u2019n my job\u2019s \nworth ter tell yeh that.\u2019 \n\n\n\n58 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nGriphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected \nmore marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passage-\nway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downwards and \nthere were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled \nand a small cart came hurtling up the tracks towards them. They \nclimbed in \u2013 Hagrid with some difficulty \u2013 and were off. \n\nAt first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. \nHarry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, \nleft, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its \nown way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering. \n\nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept \nthem wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end \nof a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late \n\u2013 they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where \nhuge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \n\n\u2018I never know,\u2019 Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, \n\u2018what\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Stalagmite\u2019s got an \u201cm\u201d in it,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018An\u2019 don\u2019 ask me \nquestions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u2019 \n\nHe did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside \na small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean \nagainst the wall to stop his knees trembling. \n\nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came bil-\nlowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds \nof gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \n\n\u2018All yours,\u2019 smiled Hagrid. \nAll Harry\u2019s \u2013 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have \n\nknown about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than \nblinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost \nthem to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune \nbelonging to him, buried deep under London. \n\nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \n\u2018The gold ones are Galleons,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Seventeen silver \n\nSickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s easy \nenough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, we\u2019ll \nkeep the rest safe for yeh.\u2019 He turned to Griphook. \u2018Vault seven \nhundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u2019 \n\n\u2018One speed only,\u2019 said Griphook. \nThey were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air \n\nbecame colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 59 \n \n\n \n\nThey went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leant \nover the side to try and see what was down at the dark bottom but \nHagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. \n\nVault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \n\u2018Stand back,\u2019 said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door \n\ngently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. \n\u2018If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they\u2019d be sucked \n\nthrough the door and trapped in there,\u2019 said Griphook. \n\u2018How often do you check to see if anyone\u2019s inside?\u2019 Harry asked. \n\u2018About once every ten years,\u2019 said Griphook, with a rather nasty \n\ngrin. \nSomething really extraordinary had to be inside this top-\n\nsecurity vault, Harry was sure, and he leant forward eagerly, \nexpecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least \u2013 but at first he \nthought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package \nwrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it \nup and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what \nit was, but knew better than to ask. \n\n\u2018Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don\u2019t talk to me on the \nway back, it\u2019s best if I keep me mouth shut,\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\n* \nOne wild cart-ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight out-\nside Gringotts. Harry didn\u2019t know where to run first now that he \nhad a bag full of money. He didn\u2019t have to know how many \nGalleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more \nmoney than he\u2019d had in his whole life \u2013 more money than even \nDudley had ever had. \n\n\u2018Might as well get yer uniform,\u2019 said Hagrid, nodding towards \nMadam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions. \u2018Listen, Harry would yeh \nmind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I \nhate them Gringotts carts.\u2019 He did still look a bit sick, so Harry \nentered Madam Malkin\u2019s shop alone, feeling nervous. \n\nMadam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. \n\u2018Hogwarts, dear?\u2019 she said, when Harry started to speak. \u2018Got \n\nthe lot here \u2013 another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.\u2019 \nIn the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was \n\nstanding on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long \nblack robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, \nslipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right \nlength. \n\n\n\n60 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Hullo,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018Hogwarts too?\u2019 \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018My father\u2019s next door buying my books and mother\u2019s up the \n\nstreet looking at wands,\u2019 said the boy. He had a bored, drawling \nvoice. \u2018Then I\u2019m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I \ndon\u2019t see why first-years can\u2019t have their own. I think I\u2019ll bully \nfather into getting me one and I\u2019ll smuggle it in somehow.\u2019 \n\nHarry was strongly reminded of Dudley. \n\u2018Have you got your own broom?\u2019 the boy went on. \n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Play Quidditch at all?\u2019 \n\u2018No,\u2019 Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch \n\ncould be. \n\u2018I do \u2013 Father says it\u2019s a crime if I\u2019m not picked to play for my \n\nhouse, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you\u2019ll be in yet?\u2019 \n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. \n\u2018Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I \n\nknow I\u2019ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been \u2013 imagine being \nin Hufflepuff, I think I\u2019d leave, wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Mmm,\u2019 said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more \ninteresting. \n\n\u2018I say, look at that man!\u2019 said the boy suddenly, nodding \ntowards the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at \nHarry and pointing at two large ice-creams to show he couldn\u2019t \ncome in. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s Hagrid,\u2019 said Harry, pleased to know something the boy \ndidn\u2019t. \u2018He works at Hogwarts.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 said the boy, \u2018I\u2019ve heard of him. He\u2019s a sort of servant, isn\u2019t \nhe?\u2019 \n\n\u2018He\u2019s the gamekeeper,\u2019 said Harry. He was liking the boy less \nand less every second. \n\n\u2018Yes, exactly. I heard he\u2019s a sort of savage \u2013 lives in a hut in the \nschool grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do \nmagic and ends up setting fire to his bed.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s brilliant,\u2019 said Harry coldly. \n\u2018Do you?\u2019 said the boy, with a slight sneer. \u2018Why is he with you? \n\nWhere are your parents?\u2019 \n\u2018They\u2019re dead,\u2019 said Harry shortly. He didn\u2019t feel much like \n\ngoing into the matter with this boy. \n\u2018Oh, sorry,\u2019 said the other, not sounding sorry at all. \u2018But they \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 61 \n \n\n \n\nwere our kind, weren\u2019t they?\u2019 \n\u2018They were a witch and wizard, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u2019 \n\u2018I really don\u2019t think they should let the other sort in, do you? \n\nThey\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019ve never been brought up to know \nour ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until \nthey get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old \nwizarding families. What\u2019s your surname, anyway?\u2019 \n\nBut before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, \u2018That\u2019s you \ndone, my dear,\u2019 and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking \nto the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \n\n\u2018Well, I\u2019ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,\u2019 said the drawling boy. \nHarry was rather quiet as he ate the ice-cream Hagrid had \n\nbought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). \n\u2018What\u2019s up?\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and \n\nquills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that \nchanged colour as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he \nsaid, \u2018Hagrid, what\u2019s Quidditch?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin\u2019 how little yeh know \u2013 not \nknowin\u2019 about Quidditch!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t make me feel worse,\u2019 said Harry. He told Hagrid about \nthe pale boy in Madam Malkin\u2019s. \n\n\u2018\u2013 and he said people from Muggle families shouldn\u2019t even be \nallowed in \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yer not from a Muggle family. If he\u2019d known who yeh were \u2013 \nhe\u2019s grown up knowin\u2019 yer name if his parents are wizardin\u2019 folk \u2013 \nyou saw \u2019em in the Leaky Cauldron. Anyway, what does he know \nabout it, some o\u2019 the best I ever saw were the only ones with \nmagic in \u2019em in a long line o\u2019 Muggles \u2013 look at yer mum! Look \nwhat she had fer a sister!\u2019 \n\n\u2018So what is Quidditch?\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s our sport. Wizard sport. It\u2019s like \u2013 like football in the \n\nMuggle world \u2013 everyone follows Quidditch \u2013 played up in the air \non broomsticks and there\u2019s four balls \u2013 sorta hard ter explain the \nrules.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?\u2019 \n\u2018School houses. There\u2019s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot \n\no\u2019 duffers, but \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018I bet I\u2019m in Hufflepuff,\u2019 said Harry gloomily. \n\u2018Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,\u2019 said Hagrid darkly. \u2018There\u2019s \n\n\n\n62 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nnot a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn\u2019t in \nSlytherin. You-Know-Who was one.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Vol\u2013 sorry \u2013 You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?\u2019 \n\u2018Years an\u2019 years ago,\u2019 said Hagrid. \nThey bought Harry\u2019s school books in a shop called Flourish and \n\nBlotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as \nlarge as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage \nstamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few \nbooks with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read \nanything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of \nthese. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and \nCounter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies \nwith the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and \nmuch, much more) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. \n\n\u2018I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that\u2019s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic \n\nin the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,\u2019 said \nHagrid. \u2018An\u2019 anyway, yeh couldn\u2019 work any of them curses yet, \nyeh\u2019ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.\u2019 \n\nHagrid wouldn\u2019t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (\u2018It \nsays pewter on yer list\u2019), but they got a nice set of scales for \nweighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. \nThen they visited the apothecary\u2019s, which was fascinating enough \nto make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted \ncabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor, jars of herbs, \ndried roots and bright powders lined the walls, bundles of feath-\ners, strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. \nWhile Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of \nsome basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined \nsilver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, \nglittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). \n\nOutside the apothecary\u2019s, Hagrid checked Harry\u2019s list again. \n\u2018Just yer wand left \u2013 oh yeah, an\u2019 I still haven\u2019t got yeh a birth-\n\nday present.\u2019 \nHarry felt himself go red. \n\u2018You don\u2019t have to \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018I know I don\u2019t have to. Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a \n\ntoad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at \u2013 an\u2019 \nI don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the \nkids want owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer post an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u2019 \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 63 \n \n\n \n\nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which \nhad been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright \neyes. Harry now carried a large cage which held a beautiful snowy \nowl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn\u2019t stop \nstammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019 mention it,\u2019 said Hagrid gruffly. \u2018Don\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had a \nlotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now \u2013 \nonly place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best \nwand.\u2019 \n\nA magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking \nforward to. \n\nThe last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over \nthe door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC. A \nsingle wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. \n\nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as \nthey stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single \nspindly chair which Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as \nthough he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of \nnew questions which had just occurred to him and looked instead \nat the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the \nceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very \ndust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. \n\n\u2018Good afternoon,\u2019 said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must \nhave jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and \nhe got quickly off the spindly chair. \n\nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes \nshining like moons through the gloom of the shop. \n\n\u2018Hello,\u2019 said Harry awkwardly. \n\u2018Ah yes,\u2019 said the man. \u2018Yes, yes. I thought I\u2019d be seeing you \n\nsoon. Harry Potter.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a question. \u2018You have your mother\u2019s \neyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her \nfirst wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. \nNice wand for charm work.\u2019 \n\nMr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would \nblink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. \n\n\u2018Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. \nEleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for trans-\nfiguration. Well, I say your father favoured it \u2013 it\u2019s really the wand \nthat chooses the wizard, of course.\u2019 \n\nMr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were \n\n\n\n64 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nalmost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those \nmisty eyes. \n\n\u2018And that\u2019s where ...\u2019 \nMr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead \n\nwith a long, white finger. \n\u2018I\u2019m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,\u2019 he said softly. \n\n\u2018Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, \nand in the wrong hands ... Well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was \ngoing out into the world to do ...\u2019 \n\nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid. \n\u2018Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again ... Oak, \n\nsixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u2019 \n\u2018It was, sir, yes,\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\u2018Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half \n\nwhen you got expelled?\u2019 said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. \n\u2018Er \u2013 yes, they did, yes,\u2019 said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. \u2018I\u2019ve still \n\ngot the pieces, though,\u2019 he added brightly. \n\u2018But you don\u2019t use them?\u2019 said Mr Ollivander sharply. \n\u2018Oh, no, sir,\u2019 said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his \n\npink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. \n\u2018Hmmm,\u2019 said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. \n\n\u2018Well, now \u2013 Mr Potter. Let me see.\u2019 He pulled a long tape measure \nwith silver markings out of his pocket. \u2018Which is your wand arm?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 well, I\u2019m right-handed,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Hold out your arm. That\u2019s it.\u2019 He measured Harry from shoul-\n\nder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit \nand round his head. As he measured, he said, \u2018Every Ollivander \nwand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We \nuse unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of \ndragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two \nunicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, \nyou will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u2019 \n\nHarry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was meas-\nuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr \nOllivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. \n\n\u2018That will do,\u2019 he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a \nheap on the floor. \u2018Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood \nand dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it \nand give it a wave.\u2019 \n\nHarry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a \n\n\n\n DIAGON  ALLEY 65 \n \n\n \n\nbit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \n\u2018Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try \u2013\u2019 \nHarry tried \u2013 but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, \n\nwas snatched back by Mr Ollivander. \n\u2018No, no \u2013 here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, \n\nspringy. Go on, go on, try it out.\u2019 \nHarry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was \n\nwaiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and \nhigher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander \npulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. \n\n\u2018Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we\u2019ll find the perfect match \nhere somewhere \u2013 I wonder, now \u2013 yes, why not \u2013 unusual combi-\nnation \u2013 holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.\u2019 \n\nHarry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. \nHe raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down \nthrough the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot \nfrom the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on \nto the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander \ncried, \u2018Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... \nhow curious ... how very curious ...\u2019 \n\nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown \npaper, still muttering, \u2018Curious ... curious ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018but what\u2019s curious?\u2019 \nMr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. \n\u2018I remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single \n\nwand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your \nwand, gave another feather \u2013 just one other. It is very curious \nindeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother \n\u2013 why, its brother gave you that scar.\u2019 \n\nHarry swallowed. \n\u2018Yes, thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these \n\nthings happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember ... I think \nwe must expect great things from you, Mr Potter ... After all, He \nWho Must Not Be Named did great things \u2013 terrible, yes, but great.\u2019 \n\nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr Ollivander too \nmuch. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand and Mr \nOllivander bowed them from his shop. \n\n* \nThe late-afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid \nmade their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, \n\n\n\n66 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nback through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn\u2019t speak \nat all as they walked down the road; he didn\u2019t even notice how \nmuch people were gawping at them on the Underground, laden as \nthey were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the sleeping \nsnowy owl on Harry\u2019s lap. Up another escalator, out into \nPaddington station; Harry only realised where they were when \nHagrid tapped him on the shoulder. \n\n\u2018Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,\u2019 he said. \nHe bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic \n\nseats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked \nso strange, somehow. \n\n\u2018You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,\u2019 said Hagrid. \nHarry wasn\u2019t sure he could explain. He\u2019d just had the best \n\nbirthday of his life \u2013 and yet \u2013 he chewed his hamburger, trying to \nfind the words. \n\n\u2018Everyone thinks I\u2019m special,\u2019 he said at last. \u2018All those people in \nthe Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr Ollivander ... but I \ndon\u2019t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect \ngreat things? I\u2019m famous and I can\u2019t even remember what I\u2019m \nfamous for. I don\u2019t know what happened when Vol\u2013 sorry \u2013 I \nmean, the night my parents died.\u2019 \n\nHagrid leant across the table. Behind the wild beard and eye-\nbrows he wore a very kind smile. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019 you worry, Harry. You\u2019ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts \nat the beginning at Hogwarts, you\u2019ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I \nknow it\u2019s hard. Yeh\u2019ve been singled out, an\u2019 that\u2019s always hard. But \nyeh\u2019ll have a great time at Hogwarts \u2013 I did \u2013 still do, \u2019smatter of \nfact.\u2019 \n\nHagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back \nto the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. \n\n\u2018Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,\u2019 he said. \u2018First o\u2019 September \u2013 King\u2019s \nCross \u2013 it\u2019s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send \nme a letter with yer owl, she\u2019ll know where to find me ... See yeh \nsoon, Harry.\u2019 \n\nThe train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch \nHagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed \nhis nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER SIX \u2014 \n \n\nThe Journey from Platform \nNine and Three-Quarters \n\n \n\nHarry\u2019s last month with the Dursleys wasn\u2019t fun. True, Dudley was \nnow so scared of Harry he wouldn\u2019t stay in the same room, while \nAunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t shut Harry in his \ncupboard, force him to do anything or shout at him \u2013 in fact, they \ndidn\u2019t speak to him at all. Half-terrified, half-furious, they acted as \nthough any chair with Harry in it was empty. Although this was \nan improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing \nafter a while. \n\nHarry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had \ndecided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of \nMagic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed \nreading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the \nopen window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn\u2019t \ncome in to hoover any more, because Hedwig kept bringing back \ndead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off \nanother day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, \ncounting down to September the first. \n\nOn the last day of August he thought he\u2019d better speak to his \naunt and uncle about getting to King\u2019s Cross station next day, so \nhe went down to the living-room, where they were watching a \nquiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know \nhe was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 Uncle Vernon?\u2019 \nUncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. \n\u2018Er \u2013 I need to be at King\u2019s Cross tomorrow to \u2013 to go to \n\nHogwarts.\u2019 \nUncle Vernon grunted again. \n\u2018Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?\u2019 \n\n\n\n68 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nGrunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. \n\u2018Thank you.\u2019 \nHe was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually \n\nspoke. \n\u2018Funny way to get to a wizards\u2019 school, the train. Magic carpets \n\nall got punctures, have they?\u2019 \nHarry didn\u2019t say anything. \n\u2018Where is this school, anyway?\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Harry, realising this for the first time. He \n\npulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. \n\u2018I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at \n\neleven o\u2019clock,\u2019 he read. \nHis aunt and uncle stared. \n\u2018Platform what?\u2019 \n\u2018Nine and three-quarters.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t talk rubbish,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, \u2018there is no platform \n\nnine and three-quarters.\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s on my ticket.\u2019 \n\u2018Barking,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon, \u2018howling mad, the lot of them. \n\nYou\u2019ll see. You just wait. All right, we\u2019ll take you to King\u2019s Cross. \nWe\u2019re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn\u2019t bother.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why are you going to London?\u2019 Harry asked, trying to keep \nthings friendly. \n\n\u2018Taking Dudley to hospital,\u2019 growled Uncle Vernon. \u2018Got to have \nthat ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.\u2019 \n\n* \nHarry woke at five o\u2019clock the next morning and was too excited \nand nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his \njeans because he didn\u2019t want to walk into the station in his wiz-\nard\u2019s robes \u2013 he\u2019d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts \nlist yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that \nHedwig was shut safely in her cage and then paced the room, \nwaiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry\u2019s huge, \nheavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys\u2019 car, Aunt Petunia \nhad talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry and they had set off. \n\nThey reached King\u2019s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon \ndumped Harry\u2019s trunk on to a trolley and wheeled it into the sta-\ntion for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle \nVernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on \nhis face. \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 69 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine \u2013 platform ten. Your \nplatform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don\u2019t seem \nto have built it yet, do they?\u2019 \n\nHe was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number \nnine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one \nnext to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. \n\n\u2018Have a good term,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier \nsmile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the \nDursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry\u2019s \nmouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He \nwas starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. \nHe\u2019d have to ask someone. \n\nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform \nnine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts \nand when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell him what part of the country it \nwas in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stu-\npid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that \nleft at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guard said there wasn\u2019t one. In the \nend the guard strode away, muttering about time-wasters. Harry \nwas now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock \nover the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train \nto Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in \nthe middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket \nfull of wizard money and a large owl. \n\nHagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to \ndo, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon \nAlley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start \ntapping the ticket box between platforms nine and ten. \n\nAt that moment a group of people passed just behind him and \nhe caught a few words of what they were saying. \n\n\u2018\u2013 packed with Muggles, of course \u2013\u2019 \nHarry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was \n\ntalking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was \npushing a trunk like Harry\u2019s in front of him \u2013 and they had an \nowl. \n\nHeart hammering, Harry pushed his trolley after them. They \nstopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were \nsaying. \n\n\u2018Now, what\u2019s the platform number?\u2019 said the boys\u2019 mother. \n\u2018Nine and three-quarters!\u2019 piped a small girl, also red-headed, \n\n\n\n70 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwho was holding her hand. \u2018Mum, can\u2019t I go ...\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, \n\nyou go first.\u2019 \nWhat looked like the oldest boy marched towards platforms \n\nnine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he \nmissed it \u2013 but just as the boy reached the divide between the two \nplatforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of \nhim, and by the time the last rucksack had cleared away, the boy \nhad vanished. \n\n\u2018Fred, you next,\u2019 the plump woman said. \n\u2018I\u2019m not Fred, I\u2019m George,\u2019 said the boy. \u2018Honestly, woman, call \n\nyourself our mother? Can\u2019t you tell I\u2019m George?\u2019 \n\u2018Sorry, George, dear.\u2019 \n\u2018Only joking, I am Fred,\u2019 said the boy, and off he went. His twin \n\ncalled after him to hurry up, and he must have done, because a \nsecond later, he had gone \u2013 but how had he done it? \n\nNow the third brother was walking briskly towards the ticket \nbarrier \u2013 he was almost there \u2013 and then, quite suddenly, he wasn\u2019t \nanywhere. \n\nThere was nothing else for it. \n\u2018Excuse me,\u2019 Harry said to the plump woman. \n\u2018Hullo, dear,\u2019 she said. \u2018First time at Hogwarts? Ron\u2019s new, too.\u2019 \nShe pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, \n\nthin and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet and a long \nnose. \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018The thing is \u2013 the thing is, I don\u2019t know how \nto \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018How to get on to the platform?\u2019 she said kindly, and Harry \nnodded. \n\n\u2018Not to worry,\u2019 she said. \u2018All you have to do is walk straight at \nthe barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don\u2019t stop and don\u2019t \nbe scared you\u2019ll crash into it, that\u2019s very important. Best do it at a \nbit of a run if you\u2019re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 OK,\u2019 said Harry. \nHe pushed his trolley round and stared at the barrier. It looked \n\nvery solid. \nHe started to walk towards it. People jostled him on their way \n\nto platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was \ngoing to smash right into that ticket box and then he\u2019d be in \ntrouble \u2013 leaning forward on his trolley he broke into a heavy \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 71 \n \n\n \n\nrun \u2013 the barrier was coming nearer and nearer \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t be \nable to stop \u2013 the trolley was out of control \u2013 he was a foot away \u2013 \nhe closed his eyes ready for the crash \u2013 \n\nIt didn\u2019t come ... he kept on running ... he opened his eyes. \nA scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed \n\nwith people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, 11 o\u2019clock. \nHarry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway where \nthe ticket box had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-\nQuarters on it. He had done it. \n\nSmoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering \ncrowd, while cats of every colour wound here and there between \ntheir legs. Owls hooted to each other in a disgruntled sort of way \nover the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. \n\nThe first few carriages were already packed with students, some \nhanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting \nover seats. Harry pushed his trolley off down the platform in \nsearch of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was \nsaying, \u2018Gran, I\u2019ve lost my toad again.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, Neville,\u2019 he heard the old woman sigh. \nA boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. \n\u2018Give us a look, Lee, go on.\u2019 \nThe boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms and the people \n\naround him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a \nlong, hairy leg. \n\nHarry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty \ncompartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first \nand then started to shove and heave his trunk towards the train \ndoor. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end \nand twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. \n\n\u2018Want a hand?\u2019 It was one of the red-haired twins he\u2019d followed \nthrough the ticket box. \n\n\u2018Yes, please,\u2019 Harry panted. \n\u2018Oy, Fred! C\u2019mere and help!\u2019 \nWith the twins\u2019 help, Harry\u2019s trunk was at last tucked away in a \n\ncorner of the compartment. \n\u2018Thanks,\u2019 said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. \n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry\u2019s \n\nlightning scar. \n\u2018Blimey,\u2019 said the other twin. \u2018Are you \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018He is,\u2019 said the first twin. \u2018Aren\u2019t you?\u2019 he added to Harry. \n\n\n\n72 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018What?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Harry Potter,\u2019 chorused the twins. \n\u2018Oh, him,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I mean, yes, I am.\u2019 \nThe two boys gawped at him and Harry felt himself going red. \n\nThen, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train\u2019s \nopen door. \n\n\u2018Fred? George? Are you there?\u2019 \n\u2018Coming, Mum.\u2019 \nWith a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. \nHarry sat down next to the window where, half-hidden, he \n\ncould watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what \nthey were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handker-\nchief. \n\n\u2018Ron, you\u2019ve got something on your nose.\u2019 \nThe youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed \n\nhim and began rubbing the end of his nose. \n\u2018Mum \u2013 geroff.\u2019 He wriggled free. \n\u2018Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?\u2019 said one of \n\nthe twins. \n\u2018Shut up,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Where\u2019s Percy?\u2019 said their mother. \n\u2018He\u2019s coming now.\u2019 \nThe oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed \n\ninto his billowing black Hogwarts robes and Harry noticed a shiny \nred and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t stay long, Mother,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m up front, the Prefects \nhave got two compartments to themselves \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, are you a Prefect, Percy?\u2019 said one of the twins, with an air \nof great surprise. \u2018You should have said something, we had no \nidea.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,\u2019 \nsaid the other twin. \u2018Once \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Or twice \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018A minute \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018All summer \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, shut up,\u2019 said Percy the Prefect. \n\u2018How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?\u2019 said one of the \n\ntwins. \n\u2018Because he\u2019s a Prefect,\u2019 said their mother fondly. \u2018All right, dear, \n\nwell, have a good term \u2013 send me an owl when you get there.\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 73 \n \n\n \n\nShe kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to \nthe twins. \n\n\u2018Now, you two \u2013 this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one \nmore owl telling me you\u2019ve \u2013 you\u2019ve blown up a toilet or \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Blown up a toilet? We\u2019ve never blown up a toilet.\u2019 \n\u2018Great idea though, thanks, Mum.\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s not funny. And look after Ron.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.\u2019 \n\u2018Shut up,\u2019 said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins \n\nalready and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed \nit. \n\n\u2018Hey, Mum, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?\u2019 \nHarry leant back quickly so they couldn\u2019t see him looking. \n\u2018You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the \n\nstation? Know who he is?\u2019 \n\u2018Who?\u2019 \n\u2018Harry Potter!\u2019 \nHarry heard the little girl\u2019s voice. \n\u2018Oh, Mum, can I go on the train and see him, Mum, oh please ...\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn\u2019t some-\n\nthing you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you \nknow?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Asked him. Saw his scar. It\u2019s really there \u2013 like lightning.\u2019 \n\u2018Poor dear \u2013 no wonder he was alone. I wondered. He was ever \n\nso polite when he asked how to get on to the platform.\u2019 \n\u2018Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-\n\nWho looks like?\u2019 \nTheir mother suddenly became very stern. \n\u2018I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don\u2019t you dare. As though he \n\nneeds reminding of that on his first day at school.\u2019 \n\u2018All right, keep your hair on.\u2019 \nA whistle sounded. \n\u2018Hurry up!\u2019 their mother said, and the three boys clambered on \n\nto the train. They leant out of the window for her to kiss them \ngoodbye and their younger sister began to cry. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t, Ginny, we\u2019ll send you loads of owls.\u2019 \n\u2018We\u2019ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.\u2019 \n\u2018George!\u2019 \n\u2018Only joking, Mum.\u2019 \nThe train began to move. Harry saw the boys\u2019 mother waving \n\n\n\n74 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nand their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up \nwith the train until it gathered too much speed; then she fell back \nand waved. \n\nHarry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train \nrounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a \ngreat leap of excitement. He didn\u2019t know what he was going to \u2013 \nbut it had to be better than what he was leaving behind. \n\nThe door of the compartment slid open and the youngest red-\nheaded boy came in. \n\n\u2018Anyone sitting there?\u2019 he asked, pointing at the seat opposite \nHarry. \u2018Everywhere else is full.\u2019 \n\nHarry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at \nHarry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he \nhadn\u2019t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose. \n\n\u2018Hey Ron.\u2019 \nThe twins were back. \n\u2018Listen, we\u2019re going down the middle of the train \u2013 Lee Jordan\u2019s \n\ngot a giant tarantula down there.\u2019 \n\u2018Right,\u2019 mumbled Ron. \n\u2018Harry,\u2019 said the other twin, \u2018did we introduce ourselves? Fred \n\nand George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, \nthen.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Bye,\u2019 said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment door \nshut behind them. \n\n\u2018Are you really Harry Potter?\u2019 Ron blurted out. \nHarry nodded. \n\u2018Oh \u2013 well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George\u2019s \n\njokes,\u2019 said Ron. And have you really got \u2013 you know ...\u2019 \nHe pointed at Harry\u2019s forehead. \nHarry pulled back his fringe to show the lightning scar. Ron \n\nstared. \n\u2018So that\u2019s where You-Know-Who \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018but I can\u2019t remember it.\u2019 \n\u2018Nothing?\u2019 said Ron eagerly. \n\u2018Well \u2013 I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.\u2019 \n\u2018Wow,\u2019 said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments, \n\nthen, as though he had suddenly realised what he was doing, he \nlooked quickly out of the window again. \n\n\u2018Are all your family wizards?\u2019 asked Harry, who found Ron just \nas interesting as Ron found him. \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 75 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Er \u2013 yes, I think so,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018I think Mum\u2019s got a second \ncousin who\u2019s an accountant, but we never talk about him.\u2019 \n\n\u2018So you must know loads of magic already.\u2019 \nThe Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families \n\nthe pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about. \n\u2018I heard you went to live with Muggles,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018What are \n\nthey like?\u2019 \n\u2018Horrible \u2013 well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin \n\nare, though. Wish I\u2019d had three wizard brothers.\u2019 \n\u2018Five,\u2019 said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. \u2018I\u2019m \n\nthe sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I\u2019ve got a \nlot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left \u2013 Bill was Head \nBoy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy\u2019s a Prefect. \nFred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good \nmarks and everyone thinks they\u2019re really funny. Everyone expects \nme to do as well as the others, but if I do, it\u2019s no big deal, because \nthey did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five \nbrothers. I\u2019ve got Bill\u2019s old robes, Charlie\u2019s old wand and Percy\u2019s \nold rat.\u2019 \n\nRon reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat grey rat, \nwhich was asleep. \n\n\u2018His name\u2019s Scabbers and he\u2019s useless, he hardly ever wakes up. \nPercy got an owl from my dad for being made a Prefect, but they \ncouldn\u2019t aff\u2013 I mean, I got Scabbers instead.\u2019 \n\nRon\u2019s ears went pink. He seemed to think he\u2019d said too much, \nbecause he went back to staring out of the window. \n\nHarry didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with not being \nable to afford an owl. After all, he\u2019d never had any money in his \nlife until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to \nwear Dudley\u2019s old clothes and never getting proper birthday \npresents. This seemed to cheer Ron up. \n\n\u2018... and until Hagrid told me, I didn\u2019t know anything about \nbeing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort \u2013\u2019 \n\nRon gasped. \n\u2018What?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018You said You-Know-Who\u2019s name!\u2019 said Ron, sounding both \n\nshocked and impressed. \u2018I\u2019d have thought you, of all people \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,\u2019 said \n\nHarry. \u2018I just never knew you shouldn\u2019t. See what I mean? I\u2019ve \ngot loads to learn ... I bet,\u2019 he added, voicing for the first time \n\n\n\n76 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nsomething that had been worrying him a lot lately, \u2018I bet I\u2019m the \nworst in the class.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You won\u2019t be. There\u2019s loads of people who come from Muggle \nfamilies and they learn quick enough.\u2019 \n\nWhile they had been talking, the train had carried them out of \nLondon. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and \nsheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes \nflick past. \n\nAround half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in \nthe corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door \nand said, \u2018Anything off the trolley, dears?\u2019 \n\nHarry, who hadn\u2019t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron\u2019s \nears went pink again and he muttered that he\u2019d brought sand-\nwiches. Harry went out into the corridor. \n\nHe had never had any money for sweets with the Dursleys and \nnow that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was \nready to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry \u2013 but the \nwoman didn\u2019t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie \nBott\u2019s Every-Flavour Beans, Drooble\u2019s Best Blowing Gum, \nChocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Liquorice \nWands and a number of other strange things Harry had never \nseen in his life. Not wanting to miss anything, he got some of \neverything and paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven \nbronze Knuts. \n\nRon stared as Harry brought it all back into the compartment \nand tipped it on to an empty seat. \n\n\u2018Hungry, are you?\u2019 \n\u2018Starving,\u2019 said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty. \nRon had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There \n\nwere four sandwiches in there. He pulled one of them apart and \nsaid, \u2018She always forgets I don\u2019t like corned beef.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Swap you for one of these,\u2019 said Harry, holding up a pasty. \u2018Go \non \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t want this, it\u2019s all dry,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018She hasn\u2019t got much \ntime,\u2019 he added quickly, \u2018you know, with five of us.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Go on, have a pasty,\u2019 said Harry, who had never had anything \nto share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was a nice \nfeeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through all Harry\u2019s \npasties and cakes (the sandwiches lay forgotten). \n\n\u2018What are these?\u2019 Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 77 \n \n\n \n\nChocolate Frogs. \u2018They\u2019re not really frogs, are they?\u2019 He was start-\ning to feel that nothing would surprise him. \n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018But see what the card is, I\u2019m missing Agrippa.\u2019 \n\u2018What?\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, of course, you wouldn\u2019t know \u2013 Chocolate Frogs have \n\ncards inside them, you know, to collect \u2013 Famous Witches and \nWizards. I\u2019ve got about five hundred, but I haven\u2019t got Agrippa or \nPtolemy.\u2019 \n\nHarry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It \nshowed a man\u2019s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long \ncrooked nose and flowing silver hair, beard and moustache. \nUnderneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore. \n\n\u2018So this is Dumbledore!\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019d never heard of Dumbledore!\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Can \n\nI have a frog? I might get Agrippa \u2013 thanks \u2013\u2019 \nHarry turned over his card and read: \n \nAlbus Dumbledore, currently Headmaster of Hogwarts. \nConsidered by many the greatest wizard of modern  \ntimes, Professor Dumbledore is particularly famous for  \nhis defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945,  \nfor the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s  \nblood and his work on alchemy with his partner,  \nNicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys  \nchamber music and tenpin bowling. \n \nHarry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, \n\nthat Dumbledore\u2019s face had disappeared. \n\u2018He\u2019s gone!\u2019 \n\u2018Well, you can\u2019t expect him to hang around all day.\u2019 said Ron. \n\n\u2018He\u2019ll be back. No, I\u2019ve got Morgana again and I\u2019ve got about six of \nher ... do you want it? You can start collecting.\u2019 \n\nRon\u2019s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be \nunwrapped. \n\n\u2018Help yourself,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018But in, you know, the Muggle world, \npeople just stay put in photos.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Do they? What, they don\u2019t move at all?\u2019 Ron sounded amazed. \n\u2018Weird!\u2019 \n\nHarry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his \ncard and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in \n\n\n\n78 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\neating the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards \ncards, but Harry couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not \nonly Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic \nGrunnion, Circe, Paracelsus and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes \naway from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to \nopen a bag of Bertie Bott\u2019s Every-Flavour Beans. \n\n\u2018You want to be careful with those,\u2019 Ron warned Harry. \u2018When \nthey say every flavour, they mean every flavour \u2013 you know, you \nget all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar-\nmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George \nreckons he had a bogey-flavoured one once.\u2019 \n\nRon picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully and bit into a \ncorner. \n\n\u2018Bleaaargh \u2013 see? Sprouts.\u2019 \nThey had a good time eating the Every-Flavour Beans. Harry \n\ngot toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, \nsardine and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny \ngrey one Ron wouldn\u2019t touch, which turned out to be pepper. \n\nThe countryside now flying past the window was becoming \nwilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting \nrivers and dark green hills. \n\nThere was a knock on the door of their compartment and the \nround-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-\nquarters came in. He looked tearful. \n\n\u2018Sorry,\u2019 he said, \u2018but have you seen a toad at all?\u2019 \nWhen they shook their heads, he wailed, \u2018I\u2019ve lost him! He \n\nkeeps getting away from me!\u2019 \n\u2018He\u2019ll turn up,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said the boy miserably. \u2018Well, if you see him ...\u2019 \nHe left. \n\u2018Don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so bothered,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018If I\u2019d brought a \n\ntoad I\u2019d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, \nso I can\u2019t talk.\u2019 \n\nThe rat was still snoozing on Ron\u2019s lap. \n\u2018He might have died and you wouldn\u2019t know the difference,\u2019 \n\nsaid Ron in disgust. \u2018I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make \nhim more interesting, but the spell didn\u2019t work. I\u2019ll show you, \nlook ...\u2019 \n\nHe rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very \nbattered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 79 \n \n\n \n\nwhite was glinting at the end. \n\u2018Unicorn hair\u2019s nearly poking out. Anyway \u2013\u2019 \nHe had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid \n\nopen again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl \nwith him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes. \n\n\u2018Has anyone seen a toad? Neville\u2019s lost one,\u2019 she said. She had a \nbossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair and rather large front \nteeth. \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve already told him we haven\u2019t seen it,\u2019 said Ron, but the \ngirl wasn\u2019t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand. \n\n\u2018Oh, are you doing magic? Let\u2019s see it, then.\u2019 \nShe sat down. Ron looked taken aback. \n\u2018Er \u2013 all right.\u2019 \nHe cleared his throat. \n\u2018Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, \nTurn this stupid, fat rat yellow.\u2019 \nHe waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed \n\ngrey and fast asleep. \n\u2018Are you sure that\u2019s a real spell?\u2019 said the girl. \u2018Well, it\u2019s not very \n\ngood, is it? I\u2019ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it\u2019s \nall worked for me. Nobody in my family\u2019s magic at all, it was ever \nsuch a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of \ncourse, I mean, it\u2019s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I\u2019ve \nheard \u2013 I\u2019ve learnt all our set books off by heart, of course, I just \nhope it will be enough \u2013 I\u2019m Hermione Granger, by the way, who \nare you?\u2019 \n\nShe said all this very fast. \nHarry looked at Ron and was relieved to see by his stunned face \n\nthat he hadn\u2019t learnt all the set books off by heart either. \n\u2018I\u2019m Ron Weasley,\u2019 Ron muttered. \n\u2018Harry Potter,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Are you really?\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018I know all about you, of \n\ncourse \u2013 I got a few extra books for background reading, and \nyou\u2019re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark \nArts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. \n\n\u2018Am I?\u2019 said Harry, feeling dazed. \n\u2018Goodness, didn\u2019t you know, I\u2019d have found out everything I \n\ncould if it was me,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018Do either of you know what \nhouse you\u2019ll be in? I\u2019ve been asking around and I hope I\u2019m in \nGryffindor, it sounds by far the best, I hear Dumbledore himself \n\n\n\n80 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwas one, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn\u2019t be too bad ... Anyway, \nwe\u2019d better go and look for Neville\u2019s toad. You two had better \nchange, you know, I expect we\u2019ll be there soon.\u2019 \n\nAnd she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \n\u2018Whatever house I\u2019m in, I hope she\u2019s not in it,\u2019 said Ron. He \n\nthrew his wand back into his trunk. \u2018Stupid spell \u2013 George gave it \nto me, bet he knew it was a dud.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What house are your brothers in?\u2019 asked Harry. \n\u2018Gryffindor,\u2019 said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him \n\nagain. \u2018Mum and Dad were in it, too. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll say \nif I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but \nimagine if they put me in Slytherin.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s the house Vol\u2013 I mean, You-Know-Who was in?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking \n\ndepressed. \n\u2018You know, I think the ends of Scabbers\u2019s whiskers are a bit \n\nlighter,\u2019 said Harry, trying to take Ron\u2019s mind off houses. \u2018So what \ndo your oldest brothers do now they\u2019ve left, anyway?\u2019 \n\nHarry was wondering what a wizard did once he\u2019d finished \nschool. \n\n\u2018Charlie\u2019s in Romania studying dragons and Bill\u2019s in Africa \ndoing something for Gringotts,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Did you hear about \nGringotts? It\u2019s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don\u2019t suppose \nyou get that with the Muggles \u2013 someone tried to rob a high-\nsecurity vault.\u2019 \n\nHarry stared. \n\u2018Really? What happened to them?\u2019 \n\u2018Nothing, that\u2019s why it\u2019s such big news. They haven\u2019t been \n\ncaught. My dad says it must\u2019ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get \nround Gringotts, but they don\u2019t think they took anything, that\u2019s \nwhat\u2019s odd. \u2019Course, everyone gets scared when something like \nthis happens in case You-Know-Who\u2019s behind it.\u2019 \n\nHarry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to get \na prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He \nsupposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but \nit had been a lot more comfortable saying \u2018Voldemort\u2019 without \nworrying. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s your Quidditch team?\u2019 Ron asked. \n\u2018Er \u2013 I don\u2019t know any,\u2019 Harry confessed. \n\u2018What!\u2019 Ron looked dumbfounded. \u2018Oh, you wait, it\u2019s the best \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 81 \n \n\n \n\ngame in the world \u2013\u2019 And he was off, explaining all about the four \nballs and the positions of the seven players, describing famous \ngames he\u2019d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he\u2019d like \nto get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the \nfiner points of the game when the compartment door slid open \nyet again, but it wasn\u2019t Neville the toadless boy or Hermione \nGranger this time. \n\nThree boys entered and Harry recognised the middle one at \nonce: it was the pale boy from Madam Malkin\u2019s robe shop. He was \nlooking at Harry with a lot more interest than he\u2019d shown back in \nDiagon Alley. \n\n\u2018Is it true?\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re saying all down the train that Harry \nPotter\u2019s in this compartment. So it\u2019s you, is it?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them \nwere thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing either side of \nthe pale boy they looked like bodyguards. \n\n\u2018Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,\u2019 said the pale boy carelessly, \nnoticing where Harry was looking. \u2018And my name\u2019s Malfoy, Draco \nMalfoy.\u2019 \n\nRon gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a \nsnigger. Draco Malfoy looked at him. \n\n\u2018Think my name\u2019s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are. \nMy father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles and \nmore children than they can afford.\u2019 \n\nHe turned back to Harry. \n\u2018You\u2019ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better \n\nthan others, Potter. You don\u2019t want to go making friends with the \nwrong sort. I can help you there.\u2019 \n\nHe held out his hand to shake Harry\u2019s, but Harry didn\u2019t take it. \n\u2018I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,\u2019 he \n\nsaid coolly. \nDraco Malfoy didn\u2019t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his \n\npale cheeks. \n\u2018I\u2019d be careful if I were you, Potter,\u2019 he said slowly. \u2018Unless \n\nyou\u2019re a bit politer you\u2019ll go the same way as your parents. They \ndidn\u2019t know what was good for them, either. You hang around \nwith riff-raff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid and it\u2019ll rub off on \nyou.\u2019 \n\nBoth Harry and Ron stood up. Ron\u2019s face was as red as his hair. \n\u2018Say that again,\u2019 he said. \n\n\n\n82 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to fight us, are you?\u2019 Malfoy sneered. \n\u2018Unless you get out now,\u2019 said Harry, more bravely than he felt, \n\nbecause Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron. \n\u2018But we don\u2019t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We\u2019ve eaten all our \n\nfood and you still seem to have some.\u2019 \nGoyle reached towards the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron \u2013 Ron \n\nleapt forward, but before he\u2019d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle \nlet out a horrible yell. \n\nScabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth \nsunk deep into Goyle\u2019s knuckle \u2013 Crabbe and Malfoy backed away \nas Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when \nScabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them \ndisappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats \nlurking among the sweets, or perhaps they\u2019d heard footsteps, \nbecause a second later, Hermione Granger had come in. \n\n\u2018What has been going on?\u2019 she said, looking at the sweets all \nover the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail. \n\n\u2018I think he\u2019s been knocked out,\u2019 Ron said to Harry. He looked \ncloser at Scabbers. \u2018No \u2013 I don\u2019t believe it \u2013 he\u2019s gone back to \nsleep.\u2019 \n\nAnd so he had. \n\u2018You\u2019ve met Malfoy before?\u2019 \nHarry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley. \n\u2018I\u2019ve heard of his family,\u2019 said Ron darkly. \u2018They were some of \n\nthe first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disap-\npeared. Said they\u2019d been bewitched. My dad doesn\u2019t believe it. He \nsays Malfoy\u2019s father didn\u2019t need an excuse to go over to the Dark \nSide.\u2019 He turned to Hermione. \u2018Can we help you with something?\u2019 \n\n\u2018You\u2019d better hurry up and put your robes on, I\u2019ve just been up \nthe front to ask the driver and he says we\u2019re nearly there. You \nhaven\u2019t been fighting, have you? You\u2019ll be in trouble before we \neven get there!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Scabbers has been fighting, not us,\u2019 said Ron, scowling at her. \n\u2018Would you mind leaving while we change?\u2019 \n\n\u2018All right \u2013 I only came in here because people outside are \nbehaving very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,\u2019 said \nHermione in a sniffy voice. \u2018And you\u2019ve got dirt on your nose, by \nthe way, did you know?\u2019 \n\nRon glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It \nwas getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a \n\n\n\n THE  JOURNEY  FROM  PLATFORM  NINE  AND  THREE-QUARTERS 83 \n \n\n \n\ndeep-purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down. \nHe and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long \n\nblack robes. Ron\u2019s were a bit short for him, you could see his \ntrainers underneath them. \n\nA voice echoed through the train: \u2018We will be reaching \nHogwarts in five minutes\u2019 time. Please leave your luggage on the \ntrain, it will be taken to the school separately.\u2019 \n\nHarry\u2019s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked \npale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last \nof the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor. \n\nThe train slowed right down and finally stopped. People \npushed their way towards the door and out on to a tiny, dark \nplatform. Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came \nbobbing over the heads of the students and Harry heard a familiar \nvoice: \u2018Firs\u2019-years! Firs\u2019-years over here! All right there, Harry?\u2019 \n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads. \n\u2018C\u2019mon, follow me \u2013 any more firs\u2019-years? Mind yer step, now! \n\nFirs\u2019-years follow me!\u2019 \nSlipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what \n\nseemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark either side of \nthem that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody \nspoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed \nonce or twice. \n\n\u2018Yeh\u2019ll get yer firs\u2019 sight o\u2019 Hogwarts in a sec,\u2019 Hagrid called over \nhis shoulder, \u2018jus\u2019 round this bend here.\u2019 \n\nThere was a loud \u2018Oooooh!\u2019. \nThe narrow path had opened suddenly on to the edge of a great \n\nblack lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its \nwindows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many \nturrets and towers. \n\n\u2018No more\u2019n four to a boat!\u2019 Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of \nlittle boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were \nfollowed into their boat by Neville and Hermione. \n\n\u2018Everyone in?\u2019 shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself, \n\u2018Right then \u2013 FORWARD!\u2019 \n\nAnd the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across \nthe lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, \nstaring up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as \nthey sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood. \n\n\u2018Heads down!\u2019 yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; \n\n\n\n84 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nthey all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through \na curtain of ivy which hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They \nwere carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them \nright underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of under-\nground harbour, where they clambered out on to rocks and \npebbles. \n\n\u2018Oy, you there! Is this your toad?\u2019 said Hagrid, who was check-\ning the boats as people climbed out of them. \n\n\u2018Trevor!\u2019 cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then \nthey clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid\u2019s lamp, \ncoming out at last on to smooth, damp grass right in the shadow \nof the castle. \n\nThey walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the \nhuge, oak front door. \n\n\u2018Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?\u2019 \nHagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the \n\ncastle door. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER SEVEN \u2014 \n \n\nThe Sorting Hat \n \n\nThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in \nemerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and \nHarry\u2019s first thought was that this was not someone to cross. \n\n\u2018The firs\u2019-years, Professor McGonagall,\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\u2018Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\u2019 \nShe pulled the door wide. The Entrance Hall was so big you \n\ncould have fitted the whole of the Dursleys\u2019 house in it. The stone \nwalls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the \nceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble stair-\ncase facing them led to the upper floors. \n\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone \nfloor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a \ndoorway to the right \u2013 the rest of the school must already be here \n\u2013 but Professor McGonagall showed the first-years into a small \nempty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather \ncloser together than they would usually have done, peering about \nnervously. \n\n\u2018Welcome to Hogwarts,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall. \u2018The start-\nof-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats \nin the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting \nis a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your \nhouse will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You \nwill have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house \ndormitory and spend free time in your house common room. \n\n\u2018The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw \nand Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has \nproduced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at \nHogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any \nrule-breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the \nhouse with the most points is awarded the House Cup, a great \n\n\n\n86 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nhonour. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house \nbecomes yours. \n\n\u2018The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front \nof the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up \nas much as you can while you are waiting.\u2019 \n\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville\u2019s cloak, which was \nfastened under his left ear, and on Ron\u2019s smudged nose. Harry \nnervously tried to flatten his hair. \n\n\u2018I shall return when we are ready for you,\u2019 said Professor \nMcGonagall. \u2018Please wait quietly.\u2019 \n\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed. \n\u2018How exactly do they sort us into houses?\u2019 he asked Ron. \n\u2018Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he \n\nwas joking.\u2019 \nHarry\u2019s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole \n\nschool? But he didn\u2019t know any magic yet \u2013 what on earth would \nhe have to do? He hadn\u2019t expected something like this the \nmoment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that \neveryone else looked terrified too. No one was talking much \nexcept Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all \nthe spells she\u2019d learnt and wondering which one she\u2019d need. \nHarry tried hard not to listen to her. He\u2019d never been more \nnervous, never, not even when he\u2019d had to take a school report \nhome to the Dursleys saying that he\u2019d somehow turned his \nteacher\u2019s wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second \nnow, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his \ndoom. \n\nThen something happened which made him jump about a foot \nin the air \u2013 several people behind him screamed. \n\n\u2018What the \u2013?\u2019 \nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts \n\nhad just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly \ntransparent, they glided across the room talking to each other and \nhardly glancing at the first-years. They seemed to be arguing. \nWhat looked like a fat little monk was saying, \u2018Forgive and forget, \nI say, we ought to give him a second chance \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018My dear Friar, haven\u2019t we given Peeves all the chances he \ndeserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he\u2019s not really \neven a ghost \u2013 I say, what are you all doing here?\u2019 \n\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 87 \n \n\n \n\nfirst-years. \nNobody answered. \n\u2018New students!\u2019 said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \n\n\u2018About to be sorted, I suppose?\u2019 \nA few people nodded mutely. \n\u2018Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\u2019 said the Friar. \u2018My old house, \n\nyou know.\u2019 \n\u2018Move along now,\u2019 said a sharp voice. \u2018The Sorting Ceremony\u2019s \n\nabout to start.\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts \n\nfloated away through the opposite wall. \n\u2018Now, form a line,\u2019 Professor McGonagall told the first-years, \n\n\u2018and follow me.\u2019 \nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got \n\ninto line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and \nthey walked out of the chamber, back across the hall and through \na pair of double doors into the Great Hall. \n\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid \nplace. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles which \nwere floating in mid-air over four long tables, where the rest of \nthe students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering \ngolden plates and goblets. At the top of the Hall was another long \ntable where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led \nthe first-years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing \nthe other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds \nof faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering \ncandlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts \nshone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry \nlooked upwards and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. \nHe heard Hermione whisper, \u2018It\u2019s bewitched to look like the sky \noutside, I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.\u2019 \n\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that \nthe Great Hall didn\u2019t simply open on to the heavens. \n\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall \nsilently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first-years. On \ntop of the stool she put a pointed wizard\u2019s hat. This hat was \npatched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn\u2019t \nhave let it in the house. \n\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought \nwildly, that seemed the sort of thing \u2013 noticing that everyone in \n\n\n\n88 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nthe Hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it too. For a few \nseconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip \nnear the brim opened wide like a mouth \u2013 and the hat began to \nsing: \n\n \n\u2018Oh, you may not think I\u2019m pretty, \nBut don\u2019t judge on what you see, \nI\u2019ll eat myself if you can find \nA smarter hat than me. \nYou can keep your bowlers black, \nYour top hats sleek and tall, \nFor I\u2019m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat \nAnd I can cap them all. \nThere\u2019s nothing hidden in your head \nThe Sorting Hat can\u2019t see, \nSo try me on and I will tell you \nWhere you ought to be. \nYou might belong in Gryffindor, \nWhere dwell the brave at heart, \nTheir daring, nerve and chivalry \nSet Gryffindors apart; \nYou might belong in Hufflepuff \nWhere they are just and loyal, \nThose patient Hufflepuffs are true \nAnd unafraid of toil; \nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw, \nIf you\u2019ve a ready mind, \nWhere those of wit and learning, \nWill always find their kind; \nOr perhaps in Slytherin \nYou\u2019ll make your real friends, \nThose cunning folk use any means \nTo achieve their ends. \nSo put me on! Don\u2019t be afraid! \nAnd don\u2019t get in a flap! \nYou\u2019re in safe hands (though I have none) \nFor I\u2019m a Thinking Cap!\u2019 \n\n \nThe whole Hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It \nbowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 89 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018So we\u2019ve just got to try on the hat!\u2019 Ron whispered to Harry. \n\u2018I\u2019ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\u2019 \n\nHarry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than \nhaving to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on \nwithout everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a \nlot; Harry didn\u2019t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the \nmoment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who \nfelt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him. \n\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll \nof parchment. \n\n\u2018When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the \nstool to be sorted,\u2019 she said. \u2018Abbott, Hannah!\u2019 \n\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put \non the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A \nmoment\u2019s pause \u2013 \n\n\u2018HUFFLEPUFF!\u2019 shouted the hat. \nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to \n\nsit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat \nFriar waving merrily at her. \n\n\u2018Bones, Susan!\u2019 \n\u2018HUFFLEPUFF!\u2019 shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off \n\nto sit next to Hannah. \n\u2018Boot, Terry!\u2019 \n\u2018RAVENCLAW!\u2019 \nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several \n\nRavenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined \nthem. \n\n\u2018Brocklehurst, Mandy\u2019 went to Ravenclaw too, but \u2018Brown, \nLavender\u2019 became the first new Gryffindor and the table on the far \nleft exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron\u2019s twin brothers \ncatcalling. \n\n\u2018Bulstrode, Millicent\u2019 then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was \nHarry\u2019s imagination, after all he\u2019d heard about Slytherin, but he \nthought they looked an unpleasant lot. \n\nHe was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered \nbeing picked for teams during sports lessons at his old school. He \nhad always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, \nbut because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him. \n\n\u2018Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\u2019 \n\u2018HUFFLEPUFF!\u2019 \n\n\n\n90 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at \nonce, but at others it took a little while to decide. \u2018Finnigan, \nSeamus\u2019, the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the \nstool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a \nGryffindor. \n\n\u2018Granger, Hermione!\u2019 \nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly \n\non her head. \n\u2018GRYFFINDOR!\u2019 shouted the hat. Ron groaned. \nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do \n\nwhen you\u2019re very nervous. What if he wasn\u2019t chosen at all? What \nif he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until \nProfessor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had \nobviously been a mistake and he\u2019d better get back on the train? \n\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, \nwas called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a \nlong time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted \n\u2018GRYFFINDOR\u2019, Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog \nback amid gales of laughter to give it to \u2018MacDougal, Morag\u2019. \n\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got \nhis wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it \nscreamed, \u2018SLYTHERIN!\u2019 \n\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking \npleased with himself. \n\nThere weren\u2019t many people left now. \n\u2018Moon\u2019 ... \u2018Nott\u2019 ... \u2018Parkinson\u2019 ... then a pair of twin girls, \u2018Patil\u2019 \n\nand \u2018Patil\u2019 ... then \u2018Perks, Sally-Anne\u2019 ... and then, at last \u2013 \n\u2018Potter, Harry!\u2019 \nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like \n\nlittle hissing fires all over the hall. \n\u2018Potter, did she say?\u2019 \n\u2018The Harry Potter?\u2019 \nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes \n\nwas the Hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next \nsecond he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited. \n\n\u2018Hmm,\u2019 said a small voice in his ear. \u2018Difficult. Very difficult. \nPlenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind, either. There\u2019s talent, oh \nmy goodness, yes \u2013 and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that\u2019s \ninteresting ... So where shall I put you?\u2019 \n\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, \u2018Not \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 91 \n \n\n \n\nSlytherin, not Slytherin.\u2019 \n\u2018Not Slytherin, eh?\u2019 said the small voice. \u2018Are you sure? You \n\ncould be great, you know, it\u2019s all here in your head, and Slytherin \nwill help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that \u2013 no? \nWell, if you\u2019re sure \u2013 better be GRYFFINDOR!\u2019 \n\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole Hall. He \ntook off the hat and walked shakily towards the Gryffindor table. \nHe was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, \nhe hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy \nthe Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the \nWeasley twins yelled, \u2018We got Potter! We got Potter!\u2019 Harry sat \ndown opposite the ghost in the ruff he\u2019d seen earlier. The ghost \npatted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he\u2019d just \nplunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water. \n\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest \nhim sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs-up. \nHarry grinned back. And there, in the centre of the High Table, in \na large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognised him at \nonce from the card he\u2019d got out of the Chocolate Frog on the \ntrain. Dumbledore\u2019s silver hair was the only thing in the whole \nHall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor \nQuirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. \nHe was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban. \n\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \u2018Turpin, \nLisa\u2019 became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron\u2019s turn. He was pale \ngreen by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a \nsecond later the hat had shouted, \u2018GRYFFINDOR!\u2019 \n\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the \nchair next to him. \n\n\u2018Well done, Ron, excellent,\u2019 said Percy Weasley pompously \nacross Harry as \u2018Zabini, Blaise\u2019 was made a Slytherin. Professor \nMcGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away. \n\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just \nrealised how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages \nago. \n\nAlbus Dumbledore had got to his feet. He was beaming at the \nstudents, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased \nhim more than to see them all there. \n\n\u2018Welcome!\u2019 he said. \u2018Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! \nBefore we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And \n\n\n\n92 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nhere they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! \n\u2018Thank you!\u2019 \nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn\u2019t \n\nknow whether to laugh or not. \n\u2018Is he \u2013 a bit mad?\u2019 he asked Percy uncertainly. \n\u2018Mad?\u2019 said Percy airily. \u2018He\u2019s a genius! Best wizard in the world! \n\nBut he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\u2019 \nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now \n\npiled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat \non one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb \nchops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, \nchips, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup and, for \nsome strange reason, mint humbugs. \n\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he\u2019d never \nbeen allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken \nanything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry \npiled his plate with a bit of everything except the humbugs and \nbegan to eat. It was all delicious. \n\n\u2018That does look good,\u2019 said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching \nHarry cut up his steak. \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t you \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018I haven\u2019t eaten for nearly five hundred years,\u2019 said the ghost. \u2018I \n\ndon\u2019t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve \nintroduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your \nservice. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I know who you are!\u2019 said Ron suddenly. \u2018My brothers told me \nabout you \u2013 you\u2019re Nearly Headless Nick!\u2019 \n\n\u2018I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy \u2013\u2019 the \nghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted. \n\n\u2018Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\u2019 \nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn\u2019t \n\ngoing at all the way he wanted. \n\u2018Like this,\u2019 he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His \n\nwhole head swung off his neck and fell on to his shoulder as if it \nwas on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but \nnot done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on \ntheir faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back on to his \nneck, coughed and said, \u2018So \u2013 new Gryffindors! I hope you\u2019re \ngoing to help us win the House Championship this year? \nGryffindor have never gone so long without winning. Slytherin \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 93 \n \n\n \n\nhave got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron\u2019s becoming \nalmost unbearable \u2013 he\u2019s the Slytherin ghost.\u2019 \n\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible \nghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face and robes \nstained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry \nwas pleased to see, didn\u2019t look too pleased with the seating \narrangements. \n\n\u2018How did he get covered in blood?\u2019 asked Seamus with great \ninterest. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never asked,\u2019 said Nearly Headless Nick delicately. \nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains \n\nof the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as \nbefore. A moment later the puddings appeared. Blocks of ice-\ncream in every flavour you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, \nchocolate \u00e9clairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, jelly, rice \npudding ... \n\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their \nfamilies. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m half and half,\u2019 said Seamus. \u2018Me dad\u2019s a Muggle. Mam didn\u2019t \ntell him she was a witch \u2019til after they were married. Bit of a nasty \nshock for him.\u2019 \n\nThe others laughed. \n\u2018What about you, Neville?\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Well, my gran brought me up and she\u2019s a witch,\u2019 said Neville, \n\n\u2018but the family thought I was all Muggle for ages. My great-uncle \nAlgie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic \nout of me \u2013 he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I \nnearly drowned \u2013 but nothing happened until I was eight. Great-\nuncle Algie came round for tea and he was hanging me out of an \nupstairs window by the ankles when my great-auntie Enid offered \nhim a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced \u2013 all the \nway down the garden and into the road. They were all really \npleased. Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have \nseen their faces when I got in here \u2013 they thought I might not be \nmagic enough to come, you see. Great-uncle Algie was so pleased \nhe bought me my toad.\u2019 \n\nOn Harry\u2019s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talk-\ning about lessons (\u2018I do hope they start straight away, there\u2019s so \nmuch to learn, I\u2019m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you \nknow, turning something into something else, of course, it\u2019s \n\n\n\n94 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nsupposed to be very difficult \u2013\u2019; \u2018You\u2019ll be starting small, just \nmatches into needles and that sort of thing \u2013\u2019). \n\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at \nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. \nProfessor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. \nProfessor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher \nwith greasy black hair, a hooked nose and sallow skin. \n\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked \npast Quirrell\u2019s turban straight into Harry\u2019s eyes \u2013 and a sharp, hot \npain shot across the scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. \n\n\u2018Ouch!\u2019 Harry clapped a hand to his head. \n\u2018What is it?\u2019 asked Percy. \n\u2018N-nothing.\u2019 \nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake \n\noff was the feeling Harry had got from the teacher\u2019s look \u2013 a feel-\ning that he didn\u2019t like Harry at all. \n\n\u2018Who\u2019s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\u2019 he asked \nPercy. \n\n\u2018Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he\u2019s look-\ning so nervous, that\u2019s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he \ndoesn\u2019t want to \u2013 everyone knows he\u2019s after Quirrell\u2019s job. Knows \nan awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\u2019 \n\nHarry watched Snape for a while but Snape didn\u2019t look at him \nagain. \n\nAt last, the puddings too disappeared and Professor \nDumbledore got to his feet again. The Hall fell silent. \n\n\u2018Ahem \u2013 just a few more words now we are all fed and watered. \nI have a few start-of-term notices to give you. \n\n\u2018First-years should note that the forest in the grounds is forbid-\nden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well \nto remember that as well.\u2019 \n\nDumbledore\u2019s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the \nWeasley twins. \n\n\u2018I have also been asked by Mr Filch, the caretaker, to remind \nyou all that no magic should be used between classes in the corri-\ndors. \n\n\u2018Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of term. \nAnyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact \nMadam Hooch. \n\n\u2018And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 95 \n \n\n \n\ncorridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who \ndoes not wish to die a very painful death.\u2019 \n\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did. \n\u2018He\u2019s not serious?\u2019 he muttered to Percy. \n\u2018Must be,\u2019 said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \u2018It\u2019s odd, because \n\nhe usually gives us a reason why we\u2019re not allowed to go some-\nwhere \u2013 the forest\u2019s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. \nI do think he might have told us Prefects, at least.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\u2019 \ncried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers\u2019 smiles \nhad become rather fixed. \n\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick as if he was trying to \nget a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which \nrose high above the tables and twisted itself snake-like into words. \n\n\u2018Everyone pick their favourite tune,\u2019 said Dumbledore, \u2018and off \nwe go!\u2019 \n\nAnd the school bellowed: \n \n\n\u2018Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, \nTeach us something please, \nWhether we be old and bald \nOr young with scabby knees, \nOur heads could do with filling \nWith some interesting stuff, \nFor now they\u2019re bare and full of air, \nDead flies and bits of fluff, \nSo teach us things worth knowing, \nBring back what we\u2019ve forgot, \nJust do your best, we\u2019ll do the rest, \nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\u2019 \n\n \nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the \nWeasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral \nmarch. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand, \nand when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped \nloudest. \n\n\u2018Ah, music,\u2019 he said, wiping his eyes. \u2018A magic beyond all we do \nhere! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\u2019 \n\nThe Gryffindor first-years followed Percy through the chatter-\ning crowds, out of the Great Hall and up the marble staircase. \n\n\n\n96 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHarry\u2019s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired \nand full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the \npeople in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed \nas they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways \nhidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They \nclimbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and \nHarry was just wondering how much further they had to go when \nthey came to a sudden halt. \n\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in mid-air ahead of \nthem and as Percy took a step towards them they started throwing \nthemselves at him. \n\n\u2018Peeves,\u2019 Percy whispered to the first-years. \u2018A poltergeist.\u2019 He \nraised his voice, \u2018Peeves \u2013 show yourself.\u2019 \n\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, \nanswered. \n\n\u2018Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\u2019 \nThere was a pop and a little man with wicked dark eyes and a \n\nwide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching \nthe walking sticks. \n\n\u2018Oooooooh!\u2019 he said, with an evil cackle. \u2018Ickle firsties! What \nfun!\u2019 \n\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked. \n\u2018Go away, Peeves, or the Baron\u2019ll hear about this, I mean it!\u2019 \n\nbarked Percy. \nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walk-\n\ning sticks on Neville\u2019s head. They heard him zooming away, \nrattling coats of armour as he passed. \n\n\u2018You want to watch out for Peeves,\u2019 said Percy, as they set off \nagain. \u2018The Bloody Baron\u2019s the only one who can control him, he \nwon\u2019t even listen to us Prefects. Here we are.\u2019 \n\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat \nwoman in a pink silk dress. \n\n\u2018Password?\u2019 she said. \n\u2018Caput Draconis,\u2019 said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to \n\nreveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it \u2013 \nNeville needed a leg up \u2013 and found themselves in the Gryffindor \ncommon room, a cosy, round room full of squashy armchairs. \n\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory \nand the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase \u2013 \nthey were obviously in one of the towers \u2013 they found their beds \n\n\n\n THE  SORTING  HAT 97 \n \n\n \n\nat last: five four-posters hung with deep-red velvet curtains. Their \ntrunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they \npulled on their pyjamas and fell into bed. \n\n\u2018Great food, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Ron muttered to Harry through the hang-\nings. \u2018Get off, Scabbers! He\u2019s chewing my sheets.\u2019 \n\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he\u2019d had any of the treacle tart, \nbut he fell asleep almost at once. \n\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very \nstrange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell\u2019s turban, which \nkept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at \nonce, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn\u2019t \nwant to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull \nit off but it tightened painfully \u2013 and there was Malfoy, laughing at \nhim as he struggled with it \u2013 then Malfoy turned into the hook-\nnosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold \u2013 there \nwas a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking. \n\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next \nday, he didn\u2019t remember the dream at all. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER EIGHT \u2014 \n \n\nThe Potions Master \n \n\n\u2018There, look.\u2019 \n\u2018Where?\u2019 \n\u2018Next to the tall kid with the red hair.\u2019 \n\u2018Wearing the glasses?\u2019 \n\u2018Did you see his face?\u2019 \n\u2018Did you see his scar?\u2019 \nWhispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormi-\n\ntory next day People queuing outside classrooms stood on tiptoe \nto get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the corridors \nagain, staring. Harry wished they wouldn\u2019t, because he was trying \nto concentrate on finding his way to classes. \n\nThere were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts: \nwide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led some-\nwhere different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway \nup that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that \nwouldn\u2019t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly \nthe right place, and doors that weren\u2019t really doors at all, but solid \nwalls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where \nanything was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The \npeople in the portraits kept going to visit each other and Harry \nwas sure the coats of armour could walk. \n\nThe ghosts didn\u2019t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when \none of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to \nopen. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new \nGryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the poltergeist was \nworth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when \nyou were late for class. He would drop waste-paper baskets on \nyour head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of \nchalk or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose and \nscreech, \u2018GOT YOUR CONK!\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  POTIONS  MASTER 99 \n \n\n \n\nEven worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker, \nArgus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of \nhim on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force \ntheir way through a door which unluckily turned out to be the \nentrance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He \nwouldn\u2019t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break \ninto it on purpose and was threatening to lock them in the dungeons \nwhen they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing. \n\nFilch owned a cat called Mrs Norris, a scrawny, dust-coloured \ncreature with bulging, lamp-like eyes just like Filch\u2019s. She \npatrolled the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just \none toe out of line, and she\u2019d whisk off for Filch, who\u2019d appear, \nwheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of \nthe school better than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) \nand could pop up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students \nall hated him and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs \nNorris a good kick. \n\nAnd then, once you had managed to find them, there were the \nlessons themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry \nquickly found out, than waving your wand and saying a few \nfunny words. \n\nThey had to study the night skies through their telescopes \nevery Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different \nstars and the movements of the planets. Three times a week they \nwent out to the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, \nwith a dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they \nlearnt how to take care of all the strange plants and fungi and \nfound out what they were used for. \n\nEasily the most boring lesson was History of Magic, which was \nthe only class taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very \nold indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff-room fire \nand got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. \nBinns droned on and on while they scribbled down names and \ndates and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up. \n\nProfessor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard \nwho had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the \nstart of their first lesson he took the register, and when he reached \nHarry\u2019s name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight. \n\nProfessor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite \nright to think she wasn\u2019t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she \n\n\n\n100 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ngave them a talking-to the moment they had sat down in her first \nclass. \n\n\u2018Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous \nmagic you will learn at Hogwarts,\u2019 she said. \u2018Anyone messing \naround in my class will leave and not come back. You have been \nwarned.\u2019 \n\nThen she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They \nwere all very impressed and couldn\u2019t wait to get started, but soon \nrealised they weren\u2019t going to be changing the furniture into ani-\nmals for a long time. After making a lot of complicated notes, they \nwere each given a match and started trying to turn it into a \nneedle. By the end of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had \nmade any difference to her match; Professor McGonagall showed \nthe class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione \na rare smile. \n\nThe class everyone had really been looking forward to was \nDefence Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell\u2019s lessons turned out to \nbe a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which \neveryone said was to ward off a vampire he\u2019d met in Romania and \nwas afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. \nHis turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African \nprince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but \nthey weren\u2019t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when \nSeamus Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought \noff the zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the \nweather; for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung \naround the turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was \nstuffed full of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wher-\never he went. \n\nHarry was very relieved to find out that he wasn\u2019t miles behind \neveryone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and, \nlike him, hadn\u2019t had any idea that they were witches and wizards. \nThere was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn\u2019t have \nmuch of a head start. \n\nFriday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally \nmanaged to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast \nwithout getting lost once. \n\n\u2018What have we got today?\u2019 Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar \non his porridge. \n\n\u2018Double Potions with the Slytherins,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Snape\u2019s Head of \n\n\n\n THE  POTIONS  MASTER 101 \n \n\n \n\nSlytherin house. They say he always favours them \u2013 we\u2019ll be able \nto see if it\u2019s true.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Wish McGonagall favoured us,\u2019 said Harry. Professor \nMcGonagall was Head of Gryffindor house, but it hadn\u2019t stopped \nher giving them a huge pile of homework the day before. \n\nJust then, the post arrived. Harry had got used to this by now, \nbut it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, when \nabout a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great Hall \nduring breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their owners \nand dropping letters and packages on to their laps. \n\nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes \nflew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to \nsleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, \nhowever, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the \nsugar bowl and dropped a note on to Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it \nopen at once. \n\n \nDear Harry, (it said, in a very untidy scrawl) \n\nI know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like to \ncome and have a cup of tea with me around three? I want to hear \nall about your first week. Send us an answer back with Hedwig. \nHagrid \n \n\nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled \u2018Yes, please, see you later\u2019 on \nthe back of the note and sent Hedwig off again. \n\nIt was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to, \nbecause the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that \nhad happened to him so far. \n\nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had got the idea that \nProfessor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions \nlesson, he knew he\u2019d been wrong. Snape didn\u2019t dislike Harry \u2013 he \nhated him. \n\nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was \ncolder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite \ncreepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars \nall around the walls. \n\nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the register, and \nlike Flitwick, he paused at Harry\u2019s name. \n\n\u2018Ah, yes,\u2019 he said softly, \u2018Harry Potter. Our new \u2013 celebrity.\u2019 \nDraco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered \n\n\n\n102 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nbehind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked \nup at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had \nnone of Hagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made \nyou think of dark tunnels. \n\n\u2018You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-\nmaking,\u2019 he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but \nthey caught every word \u2013 like Professor McGonagall, Snape had \nthe gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u2018As there is little \nfoolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is \nmagic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the \nsoftly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the deli-\ncate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching \nthe mind, ensnaring the senses ... I can teach you how to bottle \nfame, brew glory, even stopper death \u2013 if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch \nof dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u2019 \n\nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron \nexchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on \nthe edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she \nwasn\u2019t a dunderhead. \n\n\u2018Potter!\u2019 said Snape suddenly. \u2018What would I get if I added \npowdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u2019 \n\nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at \nRon, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot \ninto the air. \n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, sir,\u2019 said Harry. \nSnape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer. \n\u2018Tut, tut \u2013 fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u2019 \nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand. \n\u2018Let\u2019s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to \n\nfind me a bezoar?\u2019 \nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go \n\nwithout her leaving her seat, but Harry didn\u2019t have the faintest \nidea what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe \nand Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, sir.\u2019 \n\u2018Thought you wouldn\u2019t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?\u2019 \nHarry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold \n\neyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did \nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand \nMagical Herbs and Fungi? \n\n\n\n THE  POTIONS  MASTER 103 \n \n\n \n\nSnape was still ignoring Hermione\u2019s quivering hand. \n\u2018What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs-\n\nbane?\u2019 \nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching towards the \n\ndungeon ceiling. \n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Harry quietly. \u2018I think Hermione does, \n\nthough, why don\u2019t you try her?\u2019 \nA few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus\u2019s eye and Seamus \n\nwinked. Snape, however, was not pleased. \n\u2018Sit down,\u2019 he snapped at Hermione. \u2018For your information, \n\nPotter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so pow-\nerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a \nstone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from \nmost poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the \nsame plant, which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why \naren\u2019t you all copying that down?\u2019 \n\nThere was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over \nthe noise, Snape said, \u2018And a point will be taken from Gryffindor \nhouse for your cheek, Potter.\u2019 \n\nThings didn\u2019t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson \ncontinued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing \nup a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long \nblack cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake \nfangs, criticising almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed \nto like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way \nMalfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green \nsmoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had some-\nhow managed to melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob and \ntheir potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in \npeople\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class were standing on \ntheir stools while Neville, who had been drenched in the potion \nwhen the cauldron collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils \nsprang up all over his arms and legs. \n\n\u2018Idiot boy!\u2019 snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with \none wave of his wand. \u2018I suppose you added the porcupine quills \nbefore taking the cauldron off the fire?\u2019 \n\nNeville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose. \n\u2018Take him up to the hospital wing,\u2019 Snape spat at Seamus. Then \n\nhe rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to \nNeville. \n\n\n\n104 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018You \u2013 Potter \u2013 why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? \nThought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? \nThat\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u2019 \n\nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but \nRon kicked him behind their cauldron. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t push it,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018I\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very \nnasty.\u2019 \n\nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, \nHarry\u2019s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He\u2019d lost two \npoints for Gryffindor in his very first week \u2013 why did Snape hate \nhim so much? \n\n\u2018Cheer up,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Snape\u2019s always taking points off Fred and \nGeorge. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?\u2019 \n\nAt five to three they left the castle and made their way across \nthe grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of \nthe Forbidden Forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were out-\nside the front door. \n\nWhen Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from \ninside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid\u2019s voice rang out, \nsaying, \u2018Back, Fang \u2013 back.\u2019 \n\nHagrid\u2019s big hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the \ndoor open. \n\n\u2018Hang on,\u2019 he said. \u2018Back, Fang.\u2019 \nHe let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an \n\nenormous black boarhound. \nThere was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were \n\nhanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open \nfire and in a corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt \nover it. \n\n\u2018Make yerselves at home,\u2019 said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who \nbounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, \nFang was clearly not as fierce as he looked. \n\n\u2018This is Ron,\u2019 Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water \ninto a large teapot and putting rock cakes on to a plate. \n\n\u2018Another Weasley, eh?\u2019 said Hagrid, glancing at Ron\u2019s freckles. \u2018I \nspent half me life chasin\u2019 yer twin brothers away from the Forest.\u2019 \n\nThe rock cakes almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron \npretended to be enjoying them as they told Hagrid all about their \nfirst lessons. Fang rested his head on Harry\u2019s knee and drooled all \nover his robes. \n\n\n\n THE  POTIONS  MASTER 105 \n \n\n \n\nHarry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch \u2018that old \ngit\u2019. \n\n\u2018An\u2019 as fer that cat, Mrs Norris, I\u2019d like ter introduce her to \nFang some time. D\u2019yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, \nshe follows me everywhere? Can\u2019t get rid of her \u2013 Filch puts her \nup to it.\u2019 \n\nHarry told Hagrid about Snape\u2019s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told \nHarry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the \nstudents. \n\n\u2018But he seemed to really hate me.\u2019 \n\u2018Rubbish!\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Why should he?\u2019 \nYet Harry couldn\u2019t help thinking that Hagrid didn\u2019t quite meet \n\nhis eyes when he said that. \n\u2018How\u2019s yer brother Charlie?\u2019 Hagrid asked Ron. \u2018I liked him a lot \n\n\u2013 great with animals.\u2019 \nHarry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose. \n\nWhile Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie\u2019s work with dragons, \nHarry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under \nthe tea cosy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet: \n\n \nGRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST \n\nInvestigations continue into the break-in at Gringotts on 31 \nJuly, widely believed to be the work of dark wizards or witches \nunknown. \n\nGringotts\u2019 goblins today insisted that nothing had been \ntaken. The vault that was searched had in fact been emptied \nthe same day. \n\n\u2018But we\u2019re not telling you what was in there, so keep your \nnoses out if you know what\u2019s good for you,\u2019 said a Gringotts \nspokesgoblin this afternoon. \n \n\nHarry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had \ntried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn\u2019t mentioned the date. \n\n\u2018Hagrid!\u2019 said Harry. \u2018That Gringotts break-in happened on my \nbirthday! It might\u2019ve been happening while we were there!\u2019 \n\nThere was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn\u2019t meet \nHarry\u2019s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock \ncake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in \nfact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault \nseven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking \n\n\n\n106 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nout that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were \nlooking for? \n\nAs Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their \npockets weighed down with rock cakes they\u2019d been too polite to \nrefuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he\u2019d had so far had \ngiven him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid \ncollected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did \nHagrid know something about Snape that he didn\u2019t want to tell \nHarry? \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER NINE \u2014 \n \n\nThe Midnight Duel \n \n\nHarry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more \nthan Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first-\nyear Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they \ndidn\u2019t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn\u2019t \nuntil they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common \nroom which made them all groan. Flying lessons would be \nstarting on Thursday \u2013 and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be \nlearning together. \n\n\u2018Typical,\u2019 said Harry darkly. \u2018Just what I always wanted. To make \na fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\u2019 \n\nHe had been looking forward to learning to fly more than any-\nthing else. \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t know you\u2019ll make a fool of yourself,\u2019 said Ron rea-\nsonably. \u2018Anyway, I know Malfoy\u2019s always going on about how \ngood he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\u2019s all talk.\u2019 \n\nMalfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained \nloudly about first-years never getting in the house Quidditch \nteams and told long, boastful stories which always seemed to end \nwith him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the \nonly one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he\u2019d spent \nmost of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his \nbroomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the \ntime he\u2019d almost hit a hang-glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. \nEveryone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch con-\nstantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, \nwho shared their dormitory, about football. Ron couldn\u2019t see what \nwas exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was \nallowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of \nWest Ham football team, trying to make the players move. \n\nNeville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his \n\n\n\n108 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt \nshe\u2019d had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extra-\nordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground. \n\nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as \nNeville was. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of \na book \u2013 not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she \nbored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d got out of a library \nbook called Quidditch through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to \nher every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang \non to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased \nwhen Hermione\u2019s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the \npost. \n\nHarry hadn\u2019t had a single letter since Hagrid\u2019s note, something \nthat Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy\u2019s eagle \nowl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, \nwhich he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table. \n\nA barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grand-\nmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the \nsize of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s a Remembrall!\u2019 he explained. \u2018Gran knows I forget things \u2013 \nthis tells you if there\u2019s something you\u2019ve forgotten to do. Look, \nyou hold it tight like this and if it turns red \u2013 oh ...\u2019 His face fell, \nbecause the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \u2018... you\u2019ve \nforgotten something ...\u2019 \n\nNeville was trying to remember what he\u2019d forgotten when \nDraco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the \nRemembrall out of his hand. \n\nHarry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for \na reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could \nspot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a \nflash. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \n\u2018Malfoy\u2019s got my Remembrall, Professor.\u2019 \nScowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the \n\ntable. \n\u2018Just looking,\u2019 he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and \n\nGoyle behind him. \n* \n\nAt three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron and the other \nGryffindors hurried down the front steps into the grounds for \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 109 \n \n\n \n\ntheir first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day and the grass \nrippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns \ntowards a smooth lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the \nForbidden Forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance. \n\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broom-\nsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and \nGeorge Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that \nsome of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always \nflew slightly to the left. \n\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, grey hair \nand yellow eyes like a hawk. \n\n\u2018Well, what are you all waiting for?\u2019 she barked. \u2018Everyone stand \nby a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\u2019 \n\nHarry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the \ntwigs stuck out at odd angles. \n\n\u2018Stick out your right hand over your broom,\u2019 called Madam \nHooch at the front, \u2018and say, \u201cUp!\u201d \u2019 \n\n\u2018UP!\u2019 everyone shouted. \nHarry\u2019s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of \n\nthe few that did. Hermione Granger\u2019s had simply rolled over on \nthe ground and Neville\u2019s hadn\u2019t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like \nhorses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was \na quaver in Neville\u2019s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted \nto keep his feet on the ground. \n\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms \nwithout sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows, \ncorrecting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she \ntold Malfoy he\u2019d been doing it wrong for years. \n\n\u2018Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, \nhard,\u2019 said Madam Hooch. \u2018Keep your brooms steady, rise a few \nfeet and then come straight back down by leaning forwards slightly. \nOn my whistle \u2013 three \u2013 two \u2013\u2019 \n\nBut Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on \nthe ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched \nMadam Hooch\u2019s lips. \n\n\u2018Come back, boy!\u2019 she shouted, but Neville was rising straight \nup like a cork shot out of a bottle \u2013 twelve feet \u2013 twenty feet. \nHarry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling \naway, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and \u2013 \n\nWHAM \u2013 a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay, face down, \n\n\n\n110 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\non the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and \nhigher and started to drift lazily towards the Forbidden Forest and \nout of sight. \n\nMadam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as \nhis. \n\n\u2018Broken wrist,\u2019 Harry heard her mutter. \u2018Come on, boy \u2013 it\u2019s all \nright, up you get.\u2019 \n\nShe turned to the rest of the class. \n\u2018None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital \n\nwing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\u2019ll be out of \nHogwarts before you can say \u201cQuidditch\u201d. Come on, dear.\u2019 \n\nNeville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off \nwith Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him. \n\nNo sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into \nlaughter. \n\n\u2018Did you see his face, the great lump?\u2019 \nThe other Slytherins joined in. \n\u2018Shut up, Malfoy,\u2019 snapped Parvati Patil. \n\u2018Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\u2019 said Pansy Parkinson, a \n\nhard-faced Slytherin girl. \u2018Never thought you\u2019d like fat little cry \nbabies, Parvati.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Look!\u2019 said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something \nout of the grass. \u2018It\u2019s that stupid thing Longbottom\u2019s gran sent \nhim.\u2019 \n\nThe Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up. \n\u2018Give that here, Malfoy,\u2019 said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped \n\ntalking to watch. \nMalfoy smiled nastily. \n\u2018I think I\u2019ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to collect \u2013 how \n\nabout \u2013 up a tree?\u2019 \n\u2018Give it here!\u2019 Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt on to his \n\nbroomstick and taken off. He hadn\u2019t been lying, he could fly well \u2013 \nhovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \n\u2018Come and get it, Potter!\u2019 \n\nHarry grabbed his broom. \n\u2018No!\u2019 shouted Hermione Granger. \u2018Madam Hooch told us not to \n\nmove \u2013 you\u2019ll get us all into trouble.\u2019 \nHarry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mount-\n\ned the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he \nsoared, air rushed through his hair and his robes whipped out \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 111 \n \n\n \n\nbehind him \u2013 and in a rush of fierce joy he realised he\u2019d found \nsomething he could do without being taught \u2013 this was easy, this \nwas wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even \nhigher and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground \nand an admiring whoop from Ron. \n\nHe turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in mid-air. \nMalfoy looked stunned. \n\n\u2018Give it here,\u2019 Harry called, \u2018or I\u2019ll knock you off that broom!\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, yeah?\u2019 said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried. \nHarry knew, somehow, what to do. He leant forward and \n\ngrasped the broom tightly in both hands and it shot towards \nMalfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; \nHarry made a sharp about turn and held the broom steady. A few \npeople below were clapping. \n\n\u2018No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\u2019 Harry \ncalled. \n\nThe same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy. \n\u2018Catch it if you can, then!\u2019 he shouted, and he threw the glass \n\nball high into the air and streaked back towards the ground. \nHarry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air \n\nand then start to fall. He leant forward and pointed his broom \nhandle down \u2013 next second he was gathering speed in a steep \ndive, racing the ball \u2013 wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the \nscreams of people watching \u2013 he stretched out his hand \u2013 a foot \nfrom the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom \nstraight, and he toppled gently on to the grass with the \nRemembrall clutched safely in his fist. \n\n\u2018HARRY POTTER!\u2019 \nHis heart sank faster than he\u2019d just dived. Professor \n\nMcGonagall was running towards them. He got to his feet, trem-\nbling. \n\n\u2018Never \u2013 in all my time at Hogwarts \u2013\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and \n\nher glasses flashed furiously,\u2019 \u2013 how dare you \u2013 might have broken \nyour neck \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t his fault, Professor \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Be quiet, Miss Patil \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018But Malfoy \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018That\u2019s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\u2019 \nHarry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle\u2019s triumphant \n\n\n\n112 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nfaces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall\u2019s wake \nas she strode towards the castle. He was going to be expelled, he \njust knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but \nthere seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor \nMcGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he \nhad to jog to keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted \ntwo weeks. He\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would \nthe Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep? \n\nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still \nProfessor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a word to him. She wrenched \nopen doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting mis-\nerably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He \nthought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. \nPerhaps he could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. His stomach twisted as he \nimagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while \nhe stumped around the grounds, carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag. \n\nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened \nthe door and poked her head inside. \n\n\u2018Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a \nmoment?\u2019 \n\nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was \ngoing to use on him? \n\nBut Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who \ncame out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused. \n\n\u2018Follow me, you two,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall, and they \nmarched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \n\n\u2018In here.\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom which \n\nwas empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words \non the blackboard. \n\n\u2018Out, Peeves!\u2019 she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, \nwhich clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor \nMcGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the \ntwo boys. \n\n\u2018Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood \u2013 I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u2019 \nWood\u2019s expression changed from puzzlement to delight. \n\u2018Are you serious, Professor?\u2019 \n\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall crisply. \u2018The boy\u2019s a \n\nnatural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time \non a broomstick, Potter?\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 113 \n \n\n \n\nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on, \nbut he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling \nstarted coming back to his legs. \n\n\u2018He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\u2019 \nProfessor McGonagall told Wood. \u2018Didn\u2019t even scratch himself. \nCharlie Weasley couldn\u2019t have done it.\u2019 \n\nWood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true \nat once. \n\n\u2018Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?\u2019 he asked excitedly. \n\u2018Wood\u2019s captain of the Gryffindor team,\u2019 Professor McGonagall \n\nexplained. \n\u2018He\u2019s just the build for a Seeker, too,\u2019 said Wood, now walking \n\naround Harry and staring at him. \u2018Light \u2013 speedy \u2013 we\u2019ll have to \nget him a decent broom, Professor \u2013 a Nimbus Two Thousand or a \nCleansweep Seven, I\u2019d say.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\u2019t bend \nthe first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last \nyear. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\u2019t look \nSeverus Snape in the face for weeks ...\u2019 \n\nProfessor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry. \n\u2018I want to hear you\u2019re training hard, Potter, or I may change my \n\nmind about punishing you.\u2019 \nThen she suddenly smiled. \n\u2018Your father would have been proud,\u2019 she said. \u2018He was an \n\nexcellent Quidditch player himself.\u2019 \n* \n\n\u2018You\u2019re joking.\u2019 \nIt was dinner time. Harry had just finished telling Ron what \n\nhad happened when he\u2019d left the grounds with Professor \nMcGonagall. Ron had a piece of steak-and-kidney pie halfway to \nhis mouth, but he\u2019d forgotten all about it. \n\n\u2018Seeker?\u2019 he said. \u2018But first-years never \u2013 you must be the \nyoungest house player in about \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018\u2013 a century,\u2019 said Harry, shovelling pie into his mouth. He felt \nparticularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. \u2018Wood \ntold me.\u2019 \n\nRon was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at \nHarry. \n\n\u2018I start training next week,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Only don\u2019t tell anyone, \nWood wants to keep it a secret.\u2019 \n\n\n\n114 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nFred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted \nHarry and hurried over. \n\n\u2018Well done,\u2019 said George in a low voice. \u2018Wood told us. We\u2019re on \nthe team too \u2013 Beaters.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I tell you, we\u2019re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this \nyear,\u2019 said Fred. \u2018We haven\u2019t won since Charlie left, but this year\u2019s \nteam is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was \nalmost skipping when he told us.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Anyway, we\u2019ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he\u2019s found a new \nsecret passageway out of the school.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Bet it\u2019s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that \nwe found in our first week. See you.\u2019 \n\nFred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less \nwelcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle. \n\n\u2018Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train \nback to the Muggles?\u2019 \n\n\u2018You\u2019re a lot braver now you\u2019re back on the ground and you\u2019ve \ngot your little friends with you,\u2019 said Harry coolly. There was of \ncourse nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as the \nHigh Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more \nthan crack their knuckles and scowl. \n\n\u2018I\u2019d take you on any time on my own,\u2019 said Malfoy. \u2018Tonight, if \nyou want. Wizard\u2019s duel. Wands only \u2013 no contact. What\u2019s the \nmatter? Never heard of a wizard\u2019s duel before, I suppose?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Of course he has,\u2019 said Ron, wheeling round. \u2018I\u2019m his second, \nwho\u2019s yours?\u2019 \n\nMalfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up. \n\u2018Crabbe,\u2019 he said. \u2018Midnight all right? We\u2019ll meet you in the \n\ntrophy room, that\u2019s always unlocked.\u2019 \nWhen Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each other. \n\u2018What is a wizard\u2019s duel?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018And what do you mean, \n\nyou\u2019re my second?\u2019 \n\u2018Well, a second\u2019s there to take over if you die,\u2019 said Ron casually, \n\ngetting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry\u2019s \nface, he added quickly, \u2018but people only die in proper duels, you \nknow, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy\u2019ll be able to do \nis send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic \nto do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?\u2019 \n\u2018Throw it away and punch him on the nose,\u2019 Ron suggested. \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 115 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Excuse me.\u2019 \nThey both looked up. It was Hermione Granger. \n\u2018Can\u2019t a person eat in peace in this place?\u2019 said Ron. \nHermione ignored him and spoke to Harry. \n\u2018I couldn\u2019t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Bet you could,\u2019 Ron muttered. \n\u2018\u2013 and you mustn\u2019t go wandering around the school at night, \n\nthink of the points you\u2019ll lose Gryffindor if you\u2019re caught, and \nyou\u2019re bound to be. It\u2019s really very selfish of you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And it\u2019s really none of your business,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Goodbye,\u2019 said Ron. \n\n* \nAll the same, it wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call the perfect end to the day, \nHarry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and \nSeamus falling asleep (Neville wasn\u2019t back from the hospital \nwing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \u2018If he \ntries to curse you, you\u2019d better dodge it, because I can\u2019t remember \nhow to block them\u2019. There was a very good chance they were \ngoing to get caught by Filch or Mrs Norris, and Harry felt he was \npushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the \nother hand, Malfoy\u2019s sneering face kept looming up out of the \ndarkness \u2013 this was his big chance to beat Malfoy, face to face. He \ncouldn\u2019t miss it. \n\n\u2018Half past eleven,\u2019 Ron muttered at last. \u2018We\u2019d better go.\u2019 \nThey pulled on their dressing-gowns, picked up their wands \n\nand crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase and \ninto the Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glow-\ning in the fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black \nshadows. They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice \nspoke from the chair nearest them: \u2018I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to \ndo this, Harry.\u2019 \n\nA lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink \ndressing-gown and a frown. \n\n\u2018You!\u2019 said Ron furiously. \u2018Go back to bed!\u2019 \n\u2018I almost told your brother,\u2019 Hermione snapped. \u2018Percy \u2013 he\u2019s a \n\nPrefect, he\u2019d put a stop to this.\u2019 \nHarry couldn\u2019t believe anyone could be so interfering. \n\u2018Come on,\u2019 he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the \n\nFat Lady and climbed through the hole. \nHermione wasn\u2019t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron \n\n\n\n116 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nthrough the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose. \n\u2018Don\u2019t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about your-\n\nselves, I don\u2019t want Slytherin to win the House Cup and you\u2019ll lose \nall the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about \nSwitching Spells.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Go away.\u2019 \n\u2018All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said \n\nwhen you\u2019re on the train home tomorrow, you\u2019re so \u2013\u2019 \nBut what they were, they didn\u2019t find out. Hermione had turned \n\nto the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself \nfacing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a night-time \nvisit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower. \n\n\u2018Now what am I going to do?\u2019 she asked shrilly. \n\u2018That\u2019s your problem,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018We\u2019ve got to go, we\u2019re going to \n\nbe late.\u2019 \nThey hadn\u2019t even reached the end of the corridor when \n\nHermione caught up with them. \n\u2018I\u2019m coming with you,\u2019 she said. \n\u2018You are not.\u2019 \n\u2018D\u2019you think I\u2019m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to \n\ncatch me? If he finds all three of us I\u2019ll tell him the truth, that I \nwas trying to stop you and you can back me up.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got some nerve \u2013\u2019 said Ron loudly. \n\u2018Shut up, both of you!\u2019 said Harry sharply. \u2018I heard something.\u2019 \nIt was a sort of snuffling. \n\u2018Mrs Norris?\u2019 breathed Ron, squinting through the dark. \nIt wasn\u2019t Mrs Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the \n\nfloor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer. \n\u2018Thank goodness you found me! I\u2019ve been out here for hours. I \n\ncouldn\u2019t remember the new password to get in to bed.\u2019 \n\u2018Keep your voice down, Neville. The password\u2019s \u201cPig snout\u201d but \n\nit won\u2019t help you now, the Fat Lady\u2019s gone off somewhere.\u2019 \n\u2018How\u2019s your arm?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Fine,\u2019 said Neville, showing them. \u2018Madam Pomfrey mended it \n\nin about a minute.\u2019 \n\u2018Good \u2013 well, look, Neville, we\u2019ve got to be somewhere, we\u2019ll \n\nsee you later \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t leave me!\u2019 said Neville, scrambling to his feet. \u2018I don\u2019t \n\nwant to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron\u2019s been past twice already.\u2019 \nRon looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 117 \n \n\n \n\nand Neville. \n\u2018If either of you get us caught, I\u2019ll never rest until I\u2019ve learnt that \n\nCurse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about and used it on you.\u2019 \nHermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how \n\nto use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet \nand beckoned them all forward. \n\nThey flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight \nfrom the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into \nFilch or Mrs Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase \nto the third floor and tiptoed towards the trophy room. \n\nMalfoy and Crabbe weren\u2019t there yet. The crystal trophy cases \nglimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, \nplates and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They \nedged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either \nend of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in \nand started at once. The minutes crept by. \n\n\u2018He\u2019s late, maybe he\u2019s chickened out,\u2019 Ron whispered. \nThen a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had \n\nonly just raised his wand when they heard someone speak \u2013 and it \nwasn\u2019t Malfoy. \n\n\u2018Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.\u2019 \nIt was Filch speaking to Mrs Norris. Horror-struck, Harry \n\nwaved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as \npossible; they scurried silently towards the door away from Filch\u2019s \nvoice. Neville\u2019s robes had barely whipped round the corner when \nthey heard Filch enter the trophy room. \n\n\u2018They\u2019re in here somewhere,\u2019 they heard him mutter, \u2018probably \nhiding.\u2019 \n\n\u2018This way!\u2019 Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they \nbegan to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armour. They \ncould hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a fright-\nened squeak and broke into a run \u2013 he tripped, grabbed Ron \naround the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of \narmour. \n\nThe clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole \ncastle. \n\n\u2018RUN!\u2019 Harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the \ngallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following \u2013 \nthey swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor \nthen another, Harry in the lead without any idea where they were \n\n\n\n118 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nor where they were going. They ripped through a tapestry and \nfound themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and \ncame out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was \nmiles from the trophy room. \n\n\u2018I think we\u2019ve lost him,\u2019 Harry panted, leaning against the cold \nwall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing \nand spluttering. \n\n\u2018I \u2013 told \u2013 you,\u2019 Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in her \nchest. \u2018I \u2013 told \u2013 you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018quickly \nas possible.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Malfoy tricked you,\u2019 Hermione said to Harry. \u2018You realise that, \ndon\u2019t you? He was never going to meet you \u2013 Filch knew someone \nwas going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him \noff.\u2019 \n\nHarry thought she was probably right, but he wasn\u2019t going to \ntell her that. \n\n\u2018Let\u2019s go.\u2019 \nIt wasn\u2019t going to be that simple. They hadn\u2019t gone more than a \n\ndozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shoot-\ning out of a classroom in front of them. \n\nIt was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of \ndelight. \n\n\u2018Shut up, Peeves \u2013 please \u2013 you\u2019ll get us thrown out.\u2019 \nPeeves cackled. \n\u2018Wandering around at midnight, ickle firsties? Tut, tut, tut. \n\nNaughty, naughty, you\u2019ll get caughty.\u2019 \n\u2018Not if you don\u2019t give us away, Peeves, please.\u2019 \n\u2018Should tell Filch, I should,\u2019 said Peeves in a saintly voice, but \n\nhis eyes glittered wickedly. \u2018It\u2019s for your own good, you know.\u2019 \n\u2018Get out of the way.\u2019 snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves \u2013\n\nthis was a big mistake. \n\u2018STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\u2019 Peeves bellowed. \u2018STUDENTS \n\nOUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\u2019 \nDucking under Peeves they ran for their lives, right to the end \n\nof the corridor, where they slammed into a door \u2013 and it was \nlocked. \n\n\u2018This is it!\u2019 Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door. \n\u2018We\u2019re done for! This is the end!\u2019 \n\nThey could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could \n\n\n\n THE  MIDNIGHT  DUEL 119 \n \n\n \n\ntowards Peeves\u2019s shouts. \n\u2018Oh, move over,\u2019 Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry\u2019s wand, \n\ntapped the lock and whispered, \u2018Alohomora!\u2019 \nThe lock clicked and the door swung open \u2013 they piled through \n\nit, shut it quickly and pressed their ears against it, listening. \n\u2018Which way did they go, Peeves?\u2019 Filch was saying. \u2018Quick, tell \n\nme.\u2019 \n\u2018Say \u201cplease\u201d.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t mess me about, Peeves, now where did they go?\u2019 \n\u2018Shan\u2019t say nothing if you don\u2019t say please,\u2019 said Peeves in his \n\nannoying sing-song voice. \n\u2018All right \u2013 please.\u2019 \n\u2018NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\u2019t say nothing if you \n\ndidn\u2019t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\u2019 And they heard the sound of \nPeeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage. \n\n\u2018He thinks this door is locked,\u2019 Harry whispered. \u2018I think we\u2019ll \nbe OK \u2013 get off, Neville!\u2019 For Neville had been tugging on the \nsleeve of Harry\u2019s dressing-gown for the last minute. \u2018What?\u2019 \n\nHarry turned around \u2013 and saw, quite clearly, what. For a \nmoment, he was sure he\u2019d walked into a nightmare \u2013 this was too \nmuch, on top of everything that had happened so far. \n\nThey weren\u2019t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a \ncorridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they \nknew why it was forbidden. \n\nThey were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a \ndog which filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had \nthree heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitch-\ning and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva \nhanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs. \n\nIt was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and \nHarry knew that the only reason they weren\u2019t already dead was \nthat their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was \nquickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those \nthunderous growls meant. \n\nHarry groped for the doorknob \u2013 between Filch and death, he\u2019d \ntake Filch. \n\nThey fell backwards \u2013 Harry slammed the door shut, and they \nran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have \nhurried off to look for them somewhere else because they didn\u2019t \nsee him anywhere, but they hardly cared \u2013 all they wanted to do \n\n\n\n120 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwas put as much space as possible between them and that monster. \nThey didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat \nLady on the seventh floor. \n\n\u2018Where on earth have you all been?\u2019 she asked, looking at their \ndressing-gowns hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, \nsweaty faces. \n\n\u2018Never mind that \u2013 pig snout, pig snout,\u2019 panted Harry, and the \nportrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common room \nand collapsed, trembling into armchairs. \n\nIt was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, \nindeed, looked as if he\u2019d never speak again. \n\n\u2018What do they think they\u2019re doing, keeping a thing like that \nlocked up in a school?\u2019 said Ron finally. \u2018If any dog needs exercise, \nthat one does.\u2019 \n\nHermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back \nagain. \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t use your eyes, any of you, do you?\u2019 she snapped. \n\u2018Didn\u2019t you see what it was standing on?\u2019 \n\n\u2018The floor?\u2019 Harry suggested. \u2018I wasn\u2019t looking at its feet, I was \ntoo busy with its heads.\u2019 \n\n\u2018No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It\u2019s obviously \nguarding something.\u2019 \n\nShe stood up, glaring at them. \n\u2018I hope you\u2019re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been \n\nkilled \u2013 or worse, expelled. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to \nbed.\u2019 \n\nRon stared after her, his mouth open. \n\u2018No, we don\u2019t mind,\u2019 he said. \u2018You\u2019d think we dragged her along, \n\nwouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 \nBut Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as \n\nhe climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something ... \nWhat had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the world \nfor something you wanted to hide \u2013 except perhaps Hogwarts. \n\nIt looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby \nlittle package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER TEN \u2014 \n \n\nHallowe\u2019en \n \n\nMalfoy couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron \nwere still at Hogwarts next day, looking tired but perfectly cheer-\nful. Indeed, by next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting \nthe three-headed dog had been an excellent adventure and they \nwere quite keen to have another one. In the meantime, Harry \nfilled Ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved \nfrom Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they spent a lot of time wonder-\ning what could possibly need such heavy protection. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s either really valuable or really dangerous,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Or both,\u2019 said Harry. \nBut as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was \n\nthat it was about two inches long, they didn\u2019t have much chance \nof guessing what it was without further clues. \n\nNeither Neville or Hermione showed the slightest interest in \nwhat lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared \nabout was never going near the dog again. \n\nHermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she \nwas such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added \nbonus. All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at \nMalfoy, and to their great delight, just such a thing arrived with \nthe post about a week later. \n\nAs the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s \nattention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six \nlarge screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to \nsee what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls \nsoared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his \nbacon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when \nanother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. \n\nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it \nsaid: \n\n\n\n122 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand,  \nbut I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve  \ngot a broomstick or they\u2019ll all want one. \nOliver Wood will meet you tonight on the  \nQuidditch pitch at seven o\u2019clock for your  \nfirst training session. \n\nProfessor M. McGonagall \n \n\nHarry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron \nto read. \n\n\u2018A Nimbus Two Thousand!\u2019 Ron moaned enviously. \u2018I\u2019ve never \neven touched one.\u2019 \n\nThey left the Hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in \nprivate before their first lesson, but halfway across the Entrance \nHall they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. \nMalfoy seized the package from Harry and felt it. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s a broomstick,\u2019 he said, throwing it back to Harry with a \nmixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u2018You\u2019ll be for it this time, \nPotter, first-years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u2019 \n\nRon couldn\u2019t resist it. \n\u2018It\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u2019 he said, \u2018it\u2019s a Nimbus Two \n\nThousand. What did you say you\u2019ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet \nTwo Sixty?\u2019 Ron grinned at Harry. \u2018Comets look flashy, but they\u2019re \nnot in the same league as the Nimbus.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What would you know about it, Weasley you couldn\u2019t afford \nhalf the handle,\u2019 Malfoy snapped back. \u2018I suppose you and your \nbrothers have to save up, twig by twig.\u2019 \n\nBefore Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at \nMalfoy\u2019s elbow. \n\n\u2018Not arguing, I hope, boys?\u2019 he squeaked. \n\u2018Potter\u2019s been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u2019 said Malfoy quickly. \n\u2018Yes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u2019 said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \n\n\u2018Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circum-\nstances, Potter. And what model is it?\u2019 \n\n\u2018A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,\u2019 said Harry, fighting not to laugh \nat the look of horror on Malfoy\u2019s face. \u2018And it\u2019s really thanks to \nMalfoy here that I\u2019ve got it,\u2019 he added. \n\nHarry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at \nMalfoy\u2019s obvious rage and confusion. \n\n\n\n HALLOWE\u2019EN 123 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s true,\u2019 Harry chortled as they reached the top of the \nmarble staircase. \u2018If he hadn\u2019t stolen Neville\u2019s Remembrall I \nwouldn\u2019t be in the team ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018So I suppose you think that\u2019s a reward for breaking rules?\u2019 \ncame an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was \nstomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in \nHarry\u2019s hand. \n\n\u2018I thought you weren\u2019t speaking to us?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Yes, don\u2019t stop now,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018it\u2019s doing us so much good.\u2019 \nHermione marched away with her nose in the air. \nHarry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that \n\nday. It kept wandering up to the dormitory, where his new broom-\nstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch \npitch where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his din-\nner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then \nrushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand \nat last. \n\n\u2018Wow,\u2019 Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled on to Harry\u2019s bed-\nspread. \n\nEven Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms, \nthought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany \nhandle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two \nThousand written in gold near the top. \n\nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off \ntowards the Quidditch pitch in the dusk. He\u2019d never been inside \nthe stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands \naround the pitch so that the spectators were high enough to see \nwhat was going on. At either end of the pitch were three golden \npoles with hoops on the end. They reminded Harry of the little \nplastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that \nthey were fifty feet high. \n\nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his \nbroomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling \u2013 he \nswooped in and out of the goalposts and then sped up and down \nthe pitch. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted \nat his lightest touch. \n\n\u2018Hey, Potter, come down!\u2019 \nOliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate \n\nunder his arm. Harry landed next to him. \n\u2018Very nice,\u2019 said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u2018I see what \n\n\n\n124 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nMcGonagall meant ... you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to \nteach you the rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team prac-\ntice three times a week.\u2019 \n\nHe opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls. \n\u2018Right,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Now, Quidditch is easy enough to under-\n\nstand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on \neach side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Three Chasers,\u2019 Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red \nball about the size of a football. \n\n\u2018This ball\u2019s called the Quaffle,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018The Chasers throw \nthe Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the \nhoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes \nthrough one of the hoops. Follow me?\u2019 \n\n\u2018The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to \nscore,\u2019 Harry recited. \u2018So \u2013 that\u2019s sort of like basketball on broom-\nsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \n\n\u2018What\u2019s basketball?\u2019 said Wood curiously. \n\u2018Never mind,\u2019 said Harry quickly. \n\u2018Now, there\u2019s another player on each side who\u2019s called the \n\nKeeper \u2013 I\u2019m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our \nhoops and stop the other team from scoring.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Three Chasers, one Keeper,\u2019 said Harry, who was determined to \nremember it all. \u2018And they play with the Quaffle. OK, got that. So \nwhat are they for?\u2019 He pointed at the three balls left inside the \nbox. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll show you now,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018Take this.\u2019 \nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a rounders bat. \n\u2018I\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u2019 Wood said. \n\n\u2018These two are the Bludgers.\u2019 \nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly \n\nsmaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be \nstraining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \n\n\u2018Stand back,\u2019 Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one \nof the Bludgers. \n\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted \nstraight at Harry\u2019s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it \nbreaking his nose and sent it zig-zagging away into the air \u2013 it \nzoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived on \ntop of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \n\n\u2018See?\u2019 Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into \n\n\n\n HALLOWE\u2019EN 125 \n \n\n \n\nthe crate and strapping it down safely. \u2018The Bludgers rocket \naround trying to knock players off their brooms. That\u2019s why you \nhave two Beaters on each team. The Weasley twins are ours \u2013 it\u2019s \ntheir job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock \nthem towards the other team. So \u2013 think you\u2019ve got all that?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper \nguards the goalposts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from \ntheir team,\u2019 Harry reeled off. \n\n\u2018Very good,\u2019 said Wood. \n\u2018Er \u2013 have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?\u2019 Harry asked, \n\nhoping he sounded offhand. \n\u2018Never at Hogwarts. We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but \n\nnothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the \nSeeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle \nor the Bludgers \u2013 \u2019 \n\n\u2018\u2013 unless they crack my head open.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the \n\nBludgers \u2013 I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers them-\nselves.\u2019 \n\nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last \nball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, \nabout the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little \nfluttering silver wings. \n\n\u2018This,\u2019 said Wood, \u2018is the Golden Snitch, and it\u2019s the most \nimportant ball of the lot. It\u2019s very hard to catch because it\u2019s so fast \nand difficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s job to catch it. You\u2019ve got to \nweave in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers and Quaffle to \nget it before the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker \ncatches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty \npoints, so they nearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled \nso much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is \ncaught, so it can go on for ages \u2013 I think the record is three \nmonths, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players \ncould get some sleep. \n\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s it \u2013 any questions?\u2019 \nHarry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all \n\nright, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \n\u2018We won\u2019t practise with the Snitch yet,\u2019 said Wood, carefully \n\nshutting it back inside the crate. \u2018It\u2019s too dark, we might lose it. \nLet\u2019s try you out with a few of these.\u2019 \n\n\n\n126 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHe pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket, and a \nfew minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throw-\ning the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry \nto catch. \n\nHarry didn\u2019t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After \nhalf an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn\u2019t carry on. \n\n\u2018That Quidditch Cup\u2019ll have our name on it this year,\u2019 said \nWood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be \nsurprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he \ncould have played for England if he hadn\u2019t gone off chasing \ndragons.\u2019 \n\n* \nPerhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch \npractice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but \nHarry could hardly believe it when he realised that he\u2019d already \nbeen at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home \nthan Privet Drive had ever done. His lessons, too, were becoming \nmore and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. \n\nOn Hallowe\u2019en morning they woke to the delicious smell of bak-\ning pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor \nFlitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to \nstart making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try \nsince they\u2019d seen him make Neville\u2019s toad zoom around the class-\nroom. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practise. \nHarry\u2019s partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because \nNeville had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be \nworking with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron \nor Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn\u2019t spoken to either of \nthem since the day Harry\u2019s broomstick had arrived. \n\n\u2018Now, don\u2019t forget that nice wrist movement we\u2019ve been practis-\ning!\u2019 squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of \nbooks as usual. \u2018Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And \nsaying the magic words properly is very important, too \u2013 never \nforget Wizard Baruffio, who said \u2018s\u2019 instead of \u2018f \u2019 and found himself \non the floor with a buffalo on his chest.\u2019 \n\nIt was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, \nbut the feather they were supposed to be sending skywards just \nlay on the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it \nwith his wand and set fire to it \u2013 Harry had to put it out with his \nhat. \n\n\n\n HALLOWE\u2019EN 127 \n \n\n \n\nRon, at the next table, wasn\u2019t having much more luck. \n\u2018Wingardium Leviosa!\u2019 he shouted, waving his long arms like a \n\nwindmill. \n\u2018You\u2019re saying it wrong,\u2019 Harry heard Hermione snap. \u2018It\u2019s Wing-\n\ngar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the \u201cgar\u201d nice and long.\u2019 \n\u2018You do it, then, if you\u2019re so clever,\u2019 Ron snarled. \nHermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand \n\nand said, \u2018Wingardium Leviosa!\u2019 \nTheir feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet \n\nabove their heads. \n\u2018Oh, well done!\u2019 cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. \u2018Everyone \n\nsee here, Miss Granger\u2019s done it!\u2019 \nRon was in a very bad temper by the end of the class. \n\u2018It\u2019s no wonder no one can stand her,\u2019 he said to Harry as they \n\npushed their way into the crowded corridor. \u2018She\u2019s a nightmare, \nhonestly.\u2019 \n\nSomeone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was \nHermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face \u2013 and was startled \nto see that she was in tears. \n\n\u2018I think she heard you.\u2019 \n\u2018So?\u2019 said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. \u2018She must\u2019ve \n\nnoticed she\u2019s got no friends.\u2019 \nHermione didn\u2019t turn up for the next class and wasn\u2019t seen all \n\nafternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the \nHallowe\u2019en feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling \nher friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls\u2019 toilets \nand wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at \nthis, but a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where \nthe Hallowe\u2019en decorations put Hermione out of their minds. \n\nA thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while \na thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, \nmaking the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared \nsuddenly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term \nbanquet. \n\nHarry was just helping himself to a jacket potato when \nProfessor Quirrell came sprinting into the Hall, his turban askew \nand terror on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor \nDumbledore\u2019s chair, slumped against the table and gasped, \u2018Troll \u2013 \nin the dungeons \u2013 thought you ought to know.\u2019 \n\nHe then sank to the floor in a dead faint. \n\n\n\n128 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nThere was uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding \nfrom the end of Professor Dumbledore\u2019s wand to bring silence. \n\n\u2018Prefects,\u2019 he rumbled, \u2018lead your houses back to the dormitories \nimmediately!\u2019 \n\nPercy was in his element. \n\u2018Follow me! Stick together, first-years! No need to fear the troll \n\nif you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, \nfirst-years coming through! Excuse me, I\u2019m a Prefect!\u2019 \n\n\u2018How could a troll get in?\u2019 Harry asked as they climbed the \nstairs. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t ask me, they\u2019re supposed to be really stupid,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Maybe Peeves let it in for a Hallowe\u2019en joke.\u2019 \n\nThey passed different groups of people hurrying in different \ndirections. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused \nHufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron\u2019s arm. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve just thought \u2013 Hermione.\u2019 \n\u2018What about her?\u2019 \n\u2018She doesn\u2019t know about the troll.\u2019 \nRon bit his lip. \n\u2018Oh, all right,\u2019 he snapped. \u2018But Percy\u2019d better not see us.\u2019 \nDucking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way, \n\nslipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off towards the \ngirls\u2019 toilets. They had just turned the corner when they heard \nquick footsteps behind them. \n\n\u2018Percy!\u2019 hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin. \nPeering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He \n\ncrossed the corridor and disappeared from view. \n\u2018What\u2019s he doing?\u2019 Harry whispered. \u2018Why isn\u2019t he down in the \n\ndungeons with the rest of the teachers?\u2019 \n\u2018Search me.\u2019 \nQuietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after \n\nSnape\u2019s fading footsteps. \n\u2018He\u2019s heading for the third floor,\u2019 Harry said, but Ron held up \n\nhis hand. \n\u2018Can you smell something?\u2019 \nHarry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture \n\nof old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean. \nAnd then they heard it \u2013 a low grunting and the shuffling foot-\n\nfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed: at the end of a passage to the \nleft, something huge was moving towards them. They shrank into \n\n\n\n HALLOWE\u2019EN 129 \n \n\n \n\nthe shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight. \nIt was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, gran-\n\nite grey, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald \nhead perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree \ntrunks with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredi-\nble. It was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the \nfloor because its arms were so long. \n\nThe troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It wag-\ngled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly \ninto the room. \n\n\u2018The key\u2019s in the lock,\u2019 Harry muttered. \u2018We could lock it in.\u2019 \n\u2018Good idea,\u2019 said Ron nervously. \nThey edged towards the open door, mouths dry, praying the \n\ntroll wasn\u2019t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry \nmanaged to grab the key, slam the door and lock it. \n\n\u2018Yes!\u2019 \nFlushed with their victory they started to run back up the pas-\n\nsage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that \nmade their hearts stop \u2013 a high, petrified scream \u2013 and it was \ncoming from the chamber they\u2019d just locked up. \n\n\u2018Oh, no,\u2019 said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron. \n\u2018It\u2019s the girls\u2019 toilets!\u2019 Harry gasped. \n\u2018Hermione!\u2019 they said together. \nIt was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did \n\nthey have? Wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and \nturned the key, fumbling in their panic \u2013 Harry pulled the door \nopen \u2013 they ran inside. \n\nHermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite, \nlooking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on \nher, knocking the sinks off the walls as it went. \n\n\u2018Confuse it!\u2019 Harry said desperately to Ron, and seizing a tap he \nthrew it as hard as he could against the wall. \n\nThe troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered \naround, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its \nmean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him \ninstead, lifting its club as it went. \n\n\u2018Oy, pea-brain!\u2019 yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber, \nand he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn\u2019t even seem to \nnotice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and \npaused again, turning its ugly snout towards Ron instead, giving \n\n\n\n130 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHarry time to run around it. \n\u2018Come on, run, run!\u2019 Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull \n\nher towards the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat \nagainst the wall, her mouth open with terror. \n\nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll \nberserk. It roared again and started towards Ron, who was nearest \nand had no way to escape. \n\nHarry then did something that was both very brave and very \nstupid: he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his \narms around the troll\u2019s neck from behind. The troll couldn\u2019t feel \nHarry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long \nbit of wood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his \nhand when he\u2019d jumped \u2013 it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s \nnostrils. \n\nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with \nHarry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to \nrip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club. \n\nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his \nown wand \u2013 not knowing what he was going to do he heard him-\nself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u2018Wingardium \nLeviosa!\u2019 \n\nThe club flew suddenly out of the troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high \nup into the air, turned slowly over \u2013 and dropped, with a sicken-\ning crack, on to its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and \nthen fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room \ntremble. \n\nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron \nwas standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he \nhad done. \n\nIt was Hermione who spoke first. \n\u2018Is it \u2013 dead?\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t think so,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u2019 \nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose. It was \n\ncovered in what looked like lumpy grey glue. \n\u2018Urgh \u2013 troll bogies.\u2019 \nHe wiped it on the troll\u2019s trousers. \nA sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them \n\nlook up. They hadn\u2019t realised what a racket they had been \nmaking, but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the \ncrashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor \n\n\n\n HALLOWE\u2019EN 131 \n \n\n \n\nMcGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by \nSnape, with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look \nat the troll, let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a \ntoilet, clutching his heart. \n\nSnape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at \nRon and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips \nwere white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded \nquickly from Harry\u2019s mind. \n\n\u2018What on earth were you thinking of?\u2019 said Professor \nMcGonagall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, \nwho was still standing with his wand in the air. \u2018You\u2019re lucky you \nweren\u2019t killed. Why aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u2019 \n\nSnape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the \nfloor. He wished Ron would put his wand down. \n\nThen a small voice came out of the shadows. \n\u2018Please, Professor McGonagall \u2013 they were looking for me.\u2019 \n\u2018Miss Granger!\u2019 \nHermione had managed to get to her feet at last. \n\u2018I went looking for the troll because I \u2013 I thought I could deal \n\nwith it on my own \u2013 you know, because I\u2019ve read all about them.\u2019 \nRon dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright \n\nlie to a teacher? \n\u2018If they hadn\u2019t found me, I\u2019d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand \n\nup its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn\u2019t \nhave time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off \nwhen they arrived.\u2019 \n\nHarry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn\u2019t new to \nthem. \n\n\u2018Well \u2013 in that case ...\u2019 said Professor McGonagall, staring at the \nthree of them. \u2018Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think \nof tackling a mountain troll on your own?\u2019 \n\nHermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was \nthe last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was, \npretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape \nhad started handing out sweets. \n\n\u2018Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for \nthis,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall. \u2018I\u2019m very disappointed in you. If \nyou\u2019re not hurt at all, you\u2019d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. \nStudents are finishing the feast in their houses.\u2019 \n\nHermione left. \n\n\n\n132 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nProfessor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron. \n\u2018Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first-years could \n\nhave taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win \nGryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of \nthis. You may go.\u2019 \n\nThey hurried out of the chamber and didn\u2019t speak at all until \nthey had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the \nsmell of the troll, quite apart from anything else. \n\n\u2018We should have got more than ten points,\u2019 Ron grumbled. \n\u2018Five, you mean, once she\u2019s taken off Hermione\u2019s.\u2019 \n\u2018Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,\u2019 Ron admitted. \n\n\u2018Mind you, we did save her.\u2019 \n\u2018She might not have needed saving if we hadn\u2019t locked the thing \n\nin with her,\u2019 Harry reminded him. \nThey had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady. \n\u2018Pig snout,\u2019 they said and entered. \nThe common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating \n\nthe food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone \nby the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed \npause. Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said \n\u2018Thanks\u2019, and hurried off to get plates. \n\nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their \nfriend. There are some things you can\u2019t share without ending up \nliking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll \nis one of them. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER ELEVEN \u2014 \n \n\nQuidditch \n \n\nAs they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The \nmountains around the school became icy grey and the lake like \nchilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. \nHagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows, defrosting \nbroomsticks on the Quidditch pitch, bundled up in a long mole-\nskin overcoat, rabbit-fur gloves and enormous beaverskin boots. \n\nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be \nplaying in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor ver-\nsus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second \nplace in the House Championship. \n\nHardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided \nthat, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But \nthe news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and \nHarry didn\u2019t know which was worse \u2013 people telling him he\u2019d be \nbrilliant or people telling him they\u2019d be running around under-\nneath him, holding a mattress. \n\nIt was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. \nHe didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have got through all his homework \nwithout her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice \nWood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch \nthrough the Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read. \n\nHarry learnt that there were seven hundred ways of committing \na Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a \nWorld Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest \nand fastest players and that most serious Quidditch accidents \nseemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died play-\ning Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up \nmonths later in the Sahara Desert. \n\nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules \nsince Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll and \n\n\n\n134 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nshe was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch \nmatch the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during \nbreak, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire which \ncould be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with \ntheir backs to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. \nHarry noticed at once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron and \nHermione moved closer together to block the fire from view; they \nwere sure it wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about \ntheir guilty faces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limped over. He hadn\u2019t \nseen the fire, but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them \noff anyway. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u2019 \nIt was Quidditch through the Ages. Harry showed him. \n\u2018Library books are not to be taken outside the school,\u2019 said \n\nSnape. \u2018Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.\u2019 \n\u2018He\u2019s just made that rule up,\u2019 Harry muttered angrily as Snape \n\nlimped away. \u2018Wonder what\u2019s wrong with his leg?\u2019 \n\u2018Dunno, but I hope it\u2019s really hurting him,\u2019 said Ron bitterly. \n\n* \nThe Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, \nRon and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was \nchecking Harry and Ron\u2019s Charms homework for them. She \nwould never let them copy (\u2018How will you learn?\u2019), but by asking \nher to read it through, they got the right answers anyway. \n\nHarry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch through the Ages back, \nto take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be \nafraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was \ngoing to ask Snape if he could have it. \n\n\u2018Rather you than me,\u2019 they said together, but Harry had an idea \nthat Snape wouldn\u2019t refuse if there were other teachers listening. \n\nHe made his way down to the staff room and knocked. There \nwas no answer. He knocked again. Nothing. \n\nPerhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He \npushed the door ajar and peered inside \u2013 and a horrible scene met \nhis eyes. \n\nSnape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his \nrobes above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. \nFilch was handing Snape bandages. \n\n\u2018Blasted thing,\u2019 Snape was saying. \u2018How are you supposed to \nkeep your eyes on all three heads at once?\u2019 \n\n\n\n QUIDDITCH 135 \n \n\n \n\nHarry tried to shut the door quietly, but \u2013  \n\u2018POTTER!\u2019 \nSnape\u2019s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes \n\nquickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped. \n\u2018I just wondered if I could have my book back.\u2019 \n\u2018GET OUT! OUT!\u2019 \nHarry left, before Snape could take any more points from \n\nGryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs. \n\u2018Did you get it?\u2019 Ron asked as Harry joined them. \u2018What\u2019s the \n\nmatter?\u2019 \nIn a low whisper, Harry told them what he\u2019d seen. \n\u2018You know what this means?\u2019 he finished breathlessly. \u2018He tried \n\nto get past that three-headed dog at Hallowe\u2019en! That\u2019s where he \nwas going when we saw him \u2013 he\u2019s after whatever it\u2019s guarding! \nAnd I\u2019d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to create a diversion!\u2019 \n\nHermione\u2019s eyes were wide. \n\u2018No \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t,\u2019 she said. \u2018I know he\u2019s not very nice, but he \n\nwouldn\u2019t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.\u2019 \n\u2018Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or some-\n\nthing,\u2019 snapped Ron. \u2018I\u2019m with Harry. I wouldn\u2019t put anything past \nSnape. But what\u2019s he after? What\u2019s that dog guarding?\u2019 \n\nHarry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same ques-\ntion. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He tried \nto empty his mind \u2013 he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first \nQuidditch match in a few hours \u2013 but the expression on Snape\u2019s \nface when Harry had seen his leg wasn\u2019t easy to forget. \n\n* \nThe next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall \nwas full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheerful \nchatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch match. \n\n\u2018You\u2019ve got to eat some breakfast.\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t want anything.\u2019 \n\u2018Just a bit of toast,\u2019 wheedled Hermione. \n\u2018I\u2019m not hungry.\u2019 \nHarry felt terrible. In an hour\u2019s time he\u2019d be walking on to the \n\npitch. \n\u2018Harry, you need your strength,\u2019 said Seamus Finnigan. \u2018Seekers \n\nare always the ones who get nobbled by the other team.\u2019 \n\u2018Thanks, Seamus,\u2019 said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup on \n\nhis sausages. \n\n\n\n136 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nBy eleven o\u2019clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands \naround the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The \nseats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see \nwhat was going on sometimes. \n\nRon and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus and Dean the West \nHam fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had \npainted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. \nIt said Potter for President and Dean, who was good at drawing, \nhad done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione \nhad performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed \ndifferent colours. \n\nMeanwhile, in the changing rooms, Harry and the rest of the \nteam were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin \nwould be playing in green). \n\nWood cleared his throat for silence. \n\u2018OK, men,\u2019 he said. \n\u2018And women,\u2019 said Chaser Angelina Johnson. \n\u2018And women,\u2019 Wood agreed. \u2018This is it.\u2019 \n\u2018The big one,\u2019 said Fred Weasley. \n\u2018The one we\u2019ve all been waiting for,\u2019 said George. \n\u2018We know Oliver\u2019s speech by heart,\u2019 Fred told Harry. \u2018We were \n\nin the team last year.\u2019 \n\u2018Shut up, you two,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018This is the best team \n\nGryffindor\u2019s had in years. We\u2019re going to win. I know it.\u2019 \nHe glared at them all as if to say, \u2018Or else.\u2019 \n\u2018Right. It\u2019s time. Good luck, all of you.\u2019 \nHarry followed Fred and George out of the changing room and, \n\nhoping his knees weren\u2019t going to give way, walked on to the pitch \nto loud cheers. \n\nMadam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the \npitch, waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand. \n\n\u2018Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,\u2019 she said, once they \nwere all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be \nspeaking particularly to the Slytherin captain, Marcus Flint, a \nfifth-year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll \nblood in him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering \nbanner high above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. \nHis heart skipped. He felt braver. \n\n\u2018Mount your brooms, please.\u2019 \nHarry clambered on to his Nimbus Two Thousand. \n\n\n\n QUIDDITCH 137 \n \n\n \n\nMadam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle. \nFifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off. \n\u2018And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of \n\nGryffindor \u2013 what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather \nattractive, too \u2013 \u2019 \n\n\u2018JORDAN!\u2019 \n\u2018Sorry, Professor.\u2019 \nThe Weasley twins\u2019 friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commen-\n\ntary for the match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall. \n\u2018And she\u2019s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia \n\nSpinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood\u2019s, last year only a reserve \u2013 \nback to Johnson and \u2013 no, Slytherin have taken the Quaffle, \nSlytherin captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes \u2013 \nFlint flying like an eagle up there \u2013 he\u2019s going to sc\u2013 no, stopped \nby an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and Gryffindor \ntake the Quaffle \u2013 that\u2019s Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there, nice \ndive around Flint, off up the field and \u2013 OUCH \u2013 that must have \nhurt, hit in the back of the head by a Bludger \u2013 Quaffle taken by \nSlytherin \u2013 that\u2019s Adrian Pucey speeding off towards the goalposts, \nbut he\u2019s blocked by a second Bludger \u2013 sent his way by Fred or \nGeorge Weasley, can\u2019t tell which \u2013 nice play by the Gryffindor \nBeater, anyway, and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle, a \nclear field ahead and off she goes \u2013 she\u2019s really flying \u2013 dodges a \nspeeding Bludger \u2013 the goalposts are ahead \u2013 come on, now, \nAngelina \u2013 Keeper Bletchley dives \u2013 misses \u2013 GRYFFINDOR \nSCORE!\u2019 \n\nGryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans \nfrom the Slytherins. \n\n\u2018Budge up there, move along.\u2019 \n\u2018Hagrid!\u2019 \nRon and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough \n\nspace to join them. \n\u2018Bin watchin\u2019 from me hut,\u2019 said Hagrid, patting a large pair of \n\nbinoculars round his neck, \u2018But it isn\u2019t the same as bein\u2019 in the \ncrowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Nope,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Harry hasn\u2019t had much to do yet.\u2019 \n\u2018Kept outta trouble, though, that\u2019s somethin\u2019,\u2019 said Hagrid, \n\nraising his binoculars and peering skywards at the speck that was \nHarry. \n\nWay up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting \n\n\n\n138 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nabout for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood\u2019s \ngame plan. \n\n\u2018Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,\u2019 Wood \nhad said. \u2018We don\u2019t want you attacked before you have to be.\u2019 \n\nWhen Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-\nthe-loops to let out his feelings. Now he was back to staring \naround for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold but \nit was just a reflection from one of the Weasleys\u2019 wristwatches, \nand once a Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a \ncannon ball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley \ncame chasing after it. \n\n\u2018All right there, Harry?\u2019 he had time to yell, as he beat the \nBludger furiously towards Marcus Flint. \n\n\u2018Slytherin in possession,\u2019 Lee Jordan was saying. \u2018Chaser Pucey \nducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys and Chaser Bell and speeds \ntowards the \u2013 wait a moment \u2013 was that the Snitch?\u2019 \n\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the \nQuaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold \nthat had passed his left ear. \n\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downwards \nafter the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, \ntoo. Neck and neck they hurtled towards the Snitch \u2013 all the \nChasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be \ndoing as they hung in mid-air to watch. \n\nHarry was faster than Higgs \u2013 he could see the little round ball, \nwings fluttering, darting up ahead \u2013 he put on an extra spurt of speed \u2013  \n\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below \u2013 \nMarcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose and Harry\u2019s broom \nspan off course, Harry holding on for dear life. \n\n\u2018Foul!\u2019 screamed the Gryffindors. \nMadam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free \n\nshot at the goalposts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of \ncourse, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again. \n\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \u2018Send him off, \nref! Red card!\u2019 \n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t football, Dean,\u2019 Ron reminded him. \u2018You can\u2019t send \npeople off in Quidditch \u2013 and what\u2019s a red card?\u2019 \n\nBut Hagrid was on Dean\u2019s side. \n\u2018They oughta change the rules, Flint coulda knocked Harry \n\noutta the air.\u2019 \n\n\n\n QUIDDITCH 139 \n \n\n \n\nLee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides. \n\u2018So \u2013 after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating \u2013 \u2019 \n\u2018Jordan!\u2019 growled Professor McGonagall. \n\u2018I mean, after that open and revolting foul \u2013 \u2019 \n\u2018Jordan, I\u2019m warning you \u2013 \u2019 \n\u2018All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, \n\nwhich could happen to anyone, I\u2019m sure, so a penalty to \nGryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and \nwe continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.\u2019 \n\nIt was as Harry dodged another Bludger which went spinning \ndangerously past his head that it happened. His broom gave a \nsudden, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was \ngoing to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands \nand knees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that. \n\nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to \nbuck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly \ndecide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back towards \nthe Gryffindor goalposts; he had half a mind to ask Wood to call \ntime out \u2013 and then he realised that his broom was completely out \nof his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it. He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It \nwas zig-zagging through the air and every now and then making \nviolent swishing movements which almost unseated him. \n\nLee was still commentating. \n\u2018Slytherin in possession \u2013 Flint with the Quaffle \u2013 passes Spinnet \n\n\u2013 passes Bell \u2013 hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his \nnose \u2013 only joking, Professor \u2013 Slytherin score \u2013 oh no ...\u2019 \n\nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed \nthat Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him \nslowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it \nwent. \n\n\u2018Dunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u2019 Hagrid mumbled. He \nstared through his binoculars. \u2018If I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d \nlost control of his broom ... but he can\u2019t have ...\u2019 \n\nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. \nHis broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just \nmanaging to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry\u2019s \nbroom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now \ndangling from it, holding on with only one hand. \n\n\u2018Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?\u2019 Seamus \nwhispered. \n\n\n\n140 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t have,\u2019 Hagrid said, his voice shaking. \u2018Can\u2019t nothing \ninterfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark Magic \u2013 no kid \ncould do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.\u2019 \n\nAt these words, Hermione seized Hagrid\u2019s binoculars, but \ninstead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at \nthe crowd. \n\n\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 moaned Ron, grey-faced. \n\u2018I knew it,\u2019 Hermione gasped. \u2018Snape \u2013 look.\u2019 \nRon grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the \n\nstands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was \nmuttering non-stop under his breath. \n\n\u2018He\u2019s doing something \u2013 jinxing the broom,\u2019 said Hermione. \n\u2018What should we do?\u2019 \n\u2018Leave it to me.\u2019 \nBefore Ron could say another word, Hermione had disap-\n\npeared. Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was \nvibrating so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on \nmuch longer. The whole crowd were on their feet, watching, terri-\nfied, as the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely on to one \nof their brooms, but it was no good \u2013 every time they got near \nhim, the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and \ncircled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. \nMarcus Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without any-\none noticing. \n\n\u2018Come on, Hermione,\u2019 Ron muttered desperately. \nHermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape \n\nstood and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn\u2019t \neven stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst \ninto the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled \nout her wand and whispered a few, well chosen words. Bright blue \nflames shot from her wand on to the hem of Snape\u2019s robes. \n\nIt took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realise that he was \non fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping \nthe fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back \nalong the row \u2013 Snape would never know what had happened. \n\nIt was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clam-\nber back on to his broom. \n\n\u2018Neville, you can look!\u2019 Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into \nHagrid\u2019s jacket for the last five minutes. \n\nHarry was speeding towards the ground when the crowd saw \n\n\n\n QUIDDITCH 141 \n \n\n \n\nhim clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick \n\u2013 he hit the pitch on all fours \u2013 coughed \u2013 and something gold fell \ninto his hand. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve got the Snitch!\u2019 he shouted, waving it above his head, and \nthe game ended in complete confusion. \n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,\u2019 Flint was still howl-\ning twenty minutes later, but it made no difference \u2013 Harry hadn\u2019t \nbroken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting the \nresult \u2013 Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points \nto sixty. Harry heard none of this, though. He was being made a \ncup of strong tea back in Hagrid\u2019s hut, with Ron and Hermione. \n\n\u2018It was Snape,\u2019 Ron was explaining. \u2018Hermione and I saw him. \nHe was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn\u2019t take his \neyes off you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Rubbish,\u2019 said Hagrid, who hadn\u2019t heard a word of what had \ngone on next to him in the stands. \u2018Why would Snape do some-\nthin\u2019 like that?\u2019 \n\nHarry, Ron and Hermione looked at each other, wondering \nwhat to tell him. Harry decided on the truth. \n\n\u2018I found out something about him,\u2019 he told Hagrid. \u2018He tried to \nget past that three-headed dog at Hallowe\u2019en. It bit him. We think \nhe was trying to steal whatever it\u2019s guarding.\u2019 \n\nHagrid dropped the teapot. \n\u2018How do you know about Fluffy?\u2019 he said. \n\u2018Fluffy?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah \u2013 he\u2019s mine \u2013 bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the \n\npub las\u2019 year \u2013 I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Yes?\u2019 said Harry eagerly. \n\u2018Now, don\u2019t ask me any more,\u2019 said Hagrid gruffly. \u2018That\u2019s top \n\nsecret, that is.\u2019 \n\u2018But Snape\u2019s trying to steal it.\u2019 \n\u2018Rubbish,\u2019 said Hagrid again. \u2018Snape\u2019s a Hogwarts teacher, he\u2019d \n\ndo nothin\u2019 of the sort.\u2019 \n\u2018So why did he just try and kill Harry?\u2019 cried Hermione. \nThe afternoon\u2019s events certainly seemed to have changed her \n\nmind about Snape. \n\u2018I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I\u2019ve read all about them! \n\nYou\u2019ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn\u2019t blinking at all, I \nsaw him!\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019m tellin\u2019 yeh, yer wrong!\u2019 said Hagrid hotly. \u2018I don\u2019 know why \n\n\n\n142 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHarry\u2019s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn\u2019 try an\u2019 kill a stu-\ndent! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh \u2013 yer meddlin\u2019 in things \nthat don\u2019 concern yeh. It\u2019s dangerous. You forget that dog, an\u2019 you \nforget what it\u2019s guardin\u2019, that\u2019s between Professor Dumbledore an\u2019 \nNicolas Flamel \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Aha!\u2019 said Harry. \u2018So there\u2019s someone called Nicolas Flamel \ninvolved, is there?\u2019 \n\nHagrid looked furious with himself. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER TWELVE \u2014 \n \n\nThe Mirror of Erised \n \n\nChristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts \nwoke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. The lake froze \nsolid and the Weasley twins were punished for bewitching several \nsnowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off the \nback of his turban. The few owls that managed to battle their way \nthrough the stormy sky to deliver post had to be nursed back to \nhealth by Hagrid before they could fly off again. \n\nNo one could wait for the holidays to start. While the \nGryffindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, \nthe draughty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled \nthe windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor \nSnape\u2019s classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a \nmist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot \ncauldrons. \n\n\u2018I do feel so sorry,\u2019 said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u2018for all \nthose people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because \nthey\u2019re not wanted at home.\u2019 \n\nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle \nchuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-\nfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than \nusual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that Slytherin had \nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-\nmouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then \nhe\u2019d realised that nobody found this funny, because they were all \nso impressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his buck-\ning broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to \ntaunting Harry about having no proper family. \n\nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for \nChristmas. Professor McGonagall had come round the week \nbefore, making a list of students who would be staying for the \n\n\n\n144 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nholidays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for \nhimself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever \nhad. Ron and his brothers were staying too, because Mr and Mrs \nWeasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. \n\nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found \na large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet \nsticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them \nthat Hagrid was behind it. \n\n\u2018Hi, Hagrid, want any help?\u2019 Ron asked, sticking his head \nthrough the branches. \n\n\u2018Nah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u2019 \n\u2018Would you mind moving out of the way?\u2019 came Malfoy\u2019s cold \n\ndrawl from behind them. \u2018Are you trying to earn some extra \nmoney, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you \nleave Hogwarts, I suppose \u2013 that hut of Hagrid\u2019s must seem like a \npalace compared to what your family\u2019s used to.\u2019 \n\nRon dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs. \n\u2018WEASLEY!\u2019 \nRon let go of the front of Malfoy\u2019s robes. \n\u2018He was provoked, Professor Snape,\u2019 said Hagrid, sticking his \n\nhuge hairy face out from behind the tree. \u2018Malfoy was insultin\u2019 his \nfamily.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,\u2019 \nsaid Snape silkily. \u2018Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be \ngrateful it isn\u2019t more. Move along, all of you.\u2019 \n\nMalfoy, Crabbe and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scatter-\ning needles everywhere and smirking. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll get him,\u2019 said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy\u2019s back, \u2018one \nof these days, I\u2019ll get him \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018I hate them both,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018Malfoy and Snape.\u2019 \n\u2018Come on, cheer up, it\u2019s nearly Christmas,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Tell yeh \n\nwhat, come with me an\u2019 see the Great Hall, looks a treat.\u2019 \nSo Harry, Ron and Hermione followed Hagrid and his tree off to \n\nthe Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor \nFlitwick were busy with the Christmas decorations. \n\n\u2018Ah, Hagrid, the last tree \u2013 put it in the far corner, would you?\u2019 \nThe Hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe \n\nhung all around the walls and no fewer than twelve towering \nChristmas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny \nicicles, some glittering with hundreds of candles. \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 145 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018How many days you got left until yer holidays?\u2019 Hagrid asked. \n\u2018Just one,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018And that reminds me \u2013 Harry, Ron, \n\nwe\u2019ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the library,\u2019 \n\u2018Oh yeah, you\u2019re right,\u2019 said Ron, tearing his eyes away from \n\nProfessor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his \nwand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree. \n\n\u2018The library?\u2019 said Hagrid, following them out of the Hall. \u2018Just \nbefore the holidays? Bit keen, aren\u2019t yeh?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, we\u2019re not working,\u2019 Harry told him brightly. \u2018Ever since \nyou mentioned Nicolas Flamel we\u2019ve been trying to find out who \nhe is.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You what?\u2019 Hagrid looked shocked. \u2018Listen here \u2013 I\u2019ve told yeh \n\u2013 drop it. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 to you what that dog\u2019s guardin\u2019.\u2019 \n\n\u2018We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that\u2019s all,\u2019 said \nHermione. \n\n\u2018Unless you\u2019d like to tell us and save us the trouble?\u2019 Harry \nadded. \u2018We must\u2019ve been through hundreds of books already and \nwe can\u2019t find him anywhere \u2013 just give us a hint \u2013 I know I\u2019ve read \nhis name somewhere.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019m sayin\u2019 nothin\u2019,\u2019 said Hagrid flatly. \n\u2018Just have to find out for ourselves, then,\u2019 said Ron, and they \n\nleft Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library. \nThey had indeed been searching books for Flamel\u2019s name ever \n\nsince Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to \nfind out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was \nvery hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel \nmight have done to get himself into a book. He wasn\u2019t in Great \nWizards of the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our \nTime; he was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical \nDiscoveries, and A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And \nthen, of course, there was the sheer size of the library; tens of \nthousands of books; thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow \nrows. \n\nHermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided \nto search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started \npulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to \nthe Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if \nFlamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a \nspecially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of \nthe restricted books and he knew he\u2019d never get one. These were \n\n\n\n146 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nthe books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at \nHogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced \nDefence Against the Dark Arts. \n\n\u2018What are you looking for, boy?\u2019 \n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Harry. \nMadam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him. \n\u2018You\u2019d better get out, then. Go on \u2013 out!\u2019 \nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, \n\nHarry left the library. He, Ron and Hermione had already agreed \nthey\u2019d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. \nThey were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk \nSnape hearing what they were up to. \n\nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had \nfound anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been look-\ning for a fortnight, after all, but as they only had odd moments \nbetween lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found nothing. What \nthey really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince \nbreathing down their necks. \n\nFive minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking \ntheir heads. They went off to lunch. \n\n\u2018You will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u2019 said \nHermione. \u2018And send me an owl if you find anything.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u2019 \nsaid Ron. \u2018It\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Very safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u2019 said Hermione. \n* \n\nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too \ngood a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory \nto themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, \nso they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat \nby the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork \u2013 \nbread, crumpets, marshmallows \u2013 and plotting ways of getting \nMalfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they wouldn\u2019t \nwork. \n\nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly \nlike Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made \nit a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and \nbattered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged to \nsomeone else in his family \u2013 in this case, his grandfather. \nHowever, old chessmen weren\u2019t a drawback at all. Ron knew them \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 147 \n \n\n \n\nso well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted. \nHarry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him \n\nand they didn\u2019t trust him at all. He wasn\u2019t a very good player yet \nand they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was \nconfusing: \u2018Don\u2019t send me there, can\u2019t you see his knight? Send \nhim, we can afford to lose him.\u2019 \n\nOn Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the \nnext day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents \nat all. When he woke early next morning, however, the first thing \nhe saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed. \n\n\u2018Happy Christmas,\u2019 said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of \nbed and pulled on his dressing-gown. \n\n\u2018You too,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Will you look at this? I\u2019ve got some \npresents!\u2019 \n\n\u2018What did you expect, turnips?\u2019 said Ron, turning to his own \npile, which was a lot bigger than Harry\u2019s. \n\nHarry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown \npaper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was \na roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it him-\nself. Harry blew it \u2013 it sounded a bit like an owl. \n\nA second, very small parcel contained a note. \nWe received your message and enclose your Christmas present. \n\nFrom Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Sellotaped to the note was a \nfifty-pence piece. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s friendly,\u2019 said Harry. \nRon was fascinated by the fifty pence. \n\u2018Weird!\u2019 he said. \u2018What a shape! This is money?\u2019 \n\u2018You can keep it,\u2019 said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was. \n\n\u2018Hagrid and my aunt and uncle \u2013 so who sent these?\u2019 \n\u2018I think I know who that one\u2019s from,\u2019 said Ron, going a bit pink \n\nand pointing to a very lumpy parcel. \u2018My mum. I told her you \ndidn\u2019t expect any presents and \u2013 oh, no,\u2019 he groaned, \u2018she\u2019s made \nyou a Weasley jumper.\u2019 \n\nHarry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted \nsweater in emerald green and a large box of home-made fudge. \n\n\u2018Every year she makes us a jumper,\u2019 said Ron, unwrapping his \nown, \u2018and mine\u2019s always maroon.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s really nice of her,\u2019 said Harry, trying the fudge, which \nwas very tasty. \n\nHis next present also contained sweets \u2013 a large box of \n\n\n\n148 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nChocolate Frogs from Hermione. \nThis left only one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was \n\nvery light. He unwrapped it. \nSomething fluid and silvery grey went slithering to the floor, \n\nwhere it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped. \n\u2018I\u2019ve heard of those,\u2019 he said in a hushed voice, dropping the \n\nbox of Every-Flavour Beans he\u2019d got from Hermione. \u2018If that\u2019s \nwhat I think it is \u2013 they\u2019re really rare, and really valuable.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What is it?\u2019 \nHarry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was \n\nstrange to the touch, like water woven into material. \n\u2018It\u2019s an Invisibility Cloak,\u2019 said Ron, a look of awe on his face. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure it is \u2013 try it on.\u2019 \nHarry threw the Cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a \n\nyell. \n\u2018It is! Look down!\u2019 \nHarry looked down at his feet, but they had gone. He dashed to \n\nthe mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just \nhis head suspended in mid-air, his body completely invisible. He \npulled the Cloak over his head and his reflection vanished com-\npletely. \n\n\u2018There\u2019s a note!\u2019 said Ron suddenly. \u2018A note fell out of it!\u2019 \nHarry pulled off the Cloak and seized the letter. Written in nar-\n\nrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following \nwords: \n\n \nYour father left this in my possession before he died. \nIt is time it was returned to you. \nUse it well. \nA Very Merry Christmas to you. \n\n \nThere was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was \nadmiring the Cloak. \n\n\u2018I\u2019d give anything for one of these,\u2019 he said. \u2018Anything. What\u2019s the \nmatter?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the \nCloak? Had it really once belonged to his father? \n\nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door \nwas flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry \nstuffed the Cloak quickly out of sight. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 149 \n \n\n \n\nwith anyone else yet. \n\u2018Merry Christmas!\u2019 \n\u2018Hey, look \u2013 Harry\u2019s got a Weasley jumper, too!\u2019 \nFred and George were wearing blue jumpers, one with a large \n\nyellow F on it, the other with a large yellow G. \n\u2018Harry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u2019 said Fred, holding up \n\nHarry\u2019s jumper. \u2018She obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re \nnot family.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u2019 George demanded. \u2018Come \non, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I hate maroon,\u2019 Ron moaned half-heartedly as he pulled it over \nhis head. \n\n\u2018You haven\u2019t got a letter on yours,\u2019 George observed. \u2018I suppose \nshe thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid \u2013 we \nknow we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What\u2019s all this noise?\u2019 \nPercy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disap-\n\nproving. He had clearly come halfway through unwrapping his \npresents as he, too, carried a lumpy jumper over his arm, which \nFred seized. \n\n\u2018P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, \neven Harry got one.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I \u2013 don\u2019t \u2013 want \u2013\u2019 said Percy thickly, as the twins forced the \njumper over his head, knocking his glasses askew. \n\n\u2018And you\u2019re not sitting with the Prefects today, either,\u2019 said \nGeorge. \u2018Christmas is a time for family.\u2019 \n\nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his \nsides by his jumper. \n\n* \nHarry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A \nhundred fat, roast turkeys, mountains of roast and boiled pota-\ntoes, platters of fat chipolatas, tureens of buttered peas, silver \nboats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce \u2013 and stacks of wiz-\nard crackers every few feet along the table. These fantastic crack-\ners were nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually \nbought, with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper \nhats. Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn\u2019t just \nbang, it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them \nall in a cloud of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a \nrear-admiral\u2019s hat and several live, white mice. Up on the High \n\n\n\n150 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nTable, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard\u2019s hat for a \nflowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor \nFlitwick had just read him. \n\nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly \nbroke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry \nwatched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called \nfor more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek, \nwho, to Harry\u2019s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat \nlop-sided. \n\nWhen Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a \nstack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-\nexplodable, luminous balloons, a grow-your-own-warts kit and \nhis own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared \nand Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs \nNorris\u2019 Christmas dinner. \n\nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furi-\nous snowball fight in the grounds. Then, cold, wet and gasping \nfor breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common \nroom, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacu-\nlarly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy \nhadn\u2019t tried to help him so much. \n\nAfter a tea of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and \nChristmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much \nbefore bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all \nover Gryffindor Tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge. \n\nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had \nbeen nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed \ninto bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and \nwhoever had sent it. \n\nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to \nbother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains \nof his four-poster. Harry leant over the side of his own bed and \npulled the Cloak out from under it. \n\nHis father\u2019s ... this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material flow \nover his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the \nnote had said. \n\nHe had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the \nCloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only \nmoonlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. \n\nUse it well. \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 151 \n \n\n \n\nSuddenly, Harry felt wide awake. The whole of Hogwarts was \nopen to him in this Cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he \nstood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, \nanywhere, and Filch would never know. \n\nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something \nheld him back \u2013 his father\u2019s Cloak \u2013 he felt that this time \u2013 the \nfirst time \u2013 he wanted to use it alone. \n\nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the \ncommon room and climbed through the portrait hole. \n\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He \nwalked quickly down the corridor. \n\nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and \nthought. And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the \nlibrary. He\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took \nto find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility \nCloak tight around him as he walked. \n\nThe library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to \nsee his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was \nfloating along in mid-air, and even though Harry could feel his \narm supporting it, the sight gave him the creeps. \n\nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. \nStepping carefully over the rope which separated these books \nfrom the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \n\nThey didn\u2019t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters \nspelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had \nno title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly \nlike blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe \nhe was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering \nwas coming from the books, as though they knew someone was \nthere who shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully on \nthe floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-\nlooking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He \npulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, bal-\nancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \n\nA piercing, blood-curdling shriek split the silence \u2013 the book \nwas screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and \non, one high, unbroken, ear-splitting note. He stumbled back-\nwards and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. \nPanicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside \u2013 \n\n\n\n152 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nstuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He \npassed Filch almost in the doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked \nstraight through him and Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched \narm and streaked off up the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ring-\ning in his ears. \n\nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armour. He \nhad been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid \nattention to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he \ndidn\u2019t recognise where he was at all. There was a suit of armour \nnear the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \n\n\u2018You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was \nwandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library \u2013 \nRestricted Section.\u2019 \n\nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, \nFilch must know a short cut, because his soft, greasy voice was \ngetting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied. \n\n\u2018The Restricted Section? Well, they can\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch \nthem.\u2019 \n\nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around \nthe corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t see him, of course, but it was a \nnarrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right \ninto him \u2013 the Cloak didn\u2019t stop him being solid. \n\nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his \nleft. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his \nbreath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get \ninside the room without their noticing anything. They walked \nstraight past and Harry leant against the wall, breathing deeply, \nlistening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very \nclose. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the \nroom he had hidden in. \n\nIt looked like a disused classroom. The dark shapes of desks \nand chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned \nwaste-paper basket \u2013 but propped against the wall facing him was \nsomething that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something that \nlooked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the \nway. \n\nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an \nornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an \ninscription carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru \noyt on wohsi. \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 153 \n \n\n \n\nHis panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and \nSnape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at him-\nself but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it. \n\nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself scream-\ning. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously \nthan when the book had screamed \u2013 for he had seen not only \nhimself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right \nbehind him. \n\nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly \nback to the mirror. \n\nThere he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and \nthere, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked \nover his shoulder \u2013 but, still, no one was there. Or were they all \ninvisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and \nthis mirror\u2019s trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? \n\nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind \nhis reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a \nhand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d \ntouch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only \nair \u2013 she and the others existed only in the mirror. \n\nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her \neyes \u2013 her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little \ncloser to the glass. Bright green \u2013 exactly the same shape, but then \nhe noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same \ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his \narm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It \nstuck up at the back, just like Harry\u2019s did. \n\nHarry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly \ntouching that of his reflection. \n\n\u2018Mum?\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Dad?\u2019 \nThey just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked \n\ninto the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other \npairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old \nman who looked as though he had Harry\u2019s knobbly knees \u2013 Harry \nwas looking at his family, for the first time in his life. \n\nThe Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily \nback at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he \nwas hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a \npowerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \n\nHow long he stood there, he didn\u2019t know. The reflections did \n\n\n\n154 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nnot fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought \nhim back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his \nway back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother\u2019s face, \nwhispered, \u2018I\u2019ll come back,\u2019 and hurried from the room. \n\n* \n\u2018You could have woken me up,\u2019 said Ron, crossly. \n\n\u2018You can come tonight, I\u2019m going back, I want to show you the \nmirror.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019d like to see your mum and dad,\u2019 Ron said eagerly. \n\u2018And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be \n\nable to show me your other brothers and everyone.\u2019 \n\u2018You can see them any old time,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Just come round my \n\nhouse this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. \nShame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or \nsomething, why aren\u2019t you eating anything?\u2019 \n\nHarry couldn\u2019t eat. He had seen his parents and would be see-\ning them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It \ndidn\u2019t seem very important any more. Who cared what the three-\nheaded dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, \nreally? \n\n\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 said Ron. \u2018You look odd.\u2019 \n* \n\nWhat Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the \nmirror room again. With Ron covered in the Cloak too, they had \nto walk much more slowly next night. They tried retracing Harry\u2019s \nroute from the library, wandering around the dark passageways \nfor nearly an hour. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m freezing,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Let\u2019s forget it and go back.\u2019 \n\u2018No!\u2019 Harry hissed. \u2018I know it\u2019s here somewhere.\u2019 \nThey passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite \n\ndirection, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that \nhis feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armour. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s here \u2013 just here \u2013 yes!\u2019 \nThey pushed the door open. Harry dropped the Cloak from \n\nround his shoulders and ran to the mirror. \nThere they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of \n\nhim. \n\u2018See?\u2019 Harry whispered. \n\u2018I can\u2019t see anything.\u2019 \n\u2018Look! Look at them all ... there are loads of them ...\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 155 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018I can only see you.\u2019 \n\u2018Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.\u2019 \nHarry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he \n\ncouldn\u2019t see his family any more, just Ron in his paisley pyjamas. \nRon, though, was staring transfixed at his image. \n\u2018Look at me!\u2019 he said. \n\u2018Can you see all your family standing around you?\u2019 \n\u2018No \u2013 I\u2019m alone \u2013 but I\u2019m different \u2013 I look older \u2013 and I\u2019m \n\nHead Boy!\u2019 \n\u2018What?\u2019 \n\u2018I am \u2013 I\u2019m wearing the badge like Bill used to \u2013 and I\u2019m hold-\n\ning the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup \u2013 I\u2019m Quidditch \ncaptain, too!\u2019 \n\nRon tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly \nat Harry. \n\n\u2018Do you think this mirror shows the future?\u2019 \n\u2018How can it? All my family are dead \u2013 let me have another \n\nlook \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what\u2019s interesting \n\nabout that? I want to see my parents.\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t push me \u2013\u2019 \nA sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their dis-\n\ncussion. They hadn\u2019t realised how loudly they had been talking. \n\u2018Quick!\u2019 \nRon threw the Cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of \n\nMrs Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, \nboth thinking the same thing \u2013 did the Cloak work on cats? After \nwhat seemed an age, she turned and left. \n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t safe \u2013 she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard \nus. Come on.\u2019 \n\nAnd Ron pulled Harry out of the room. \n* \n\nThe snow still hadn\u2019t melted next morning. \n\u2018Want to play chess, Harry?\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018No.\u2019 \n\u2018Why don\u2019t we go down and visit Hagrid?\u2019 \n\u2018No ... you go ...\u2019 \n\u2018I know what you\u2019re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don\u2019t go \n\nback tonight.\u2019 \n\n\n\n156 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019 \n\u2018I dunno, I\u2019ve just got a bad feeling about it \u2013 and anyway, \n\nyou\u2019ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape and Mrs \nNorris are wandering around. So what if they can\u2019t see you? What \nif they walk into you? What if you knock something over?\u2019 \n\n\u2018You sound like Hermione.\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m serious, Harry, don\u2019t go.\u2019 \nBut Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get \n\nback in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn\u2019t going to stop him. \n* \n\nThat third night he found his way more quickly than before. He \nwas walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was \nwise, but he didn\u2019t meet anyone. \n\nAnd there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and \none of his grandfathers nodding happily Harry sank down to sit \non the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him \nstaying here all night with his family. Nothing at all. \n\nExcept \u2013 \n\u2018So \u2013 back again, Harry?\u2019 \nHarry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked \n\nbehind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none \nother than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight \npast him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn\u2019t noticed him. \n\n\u2018I \u2013 I didn\u2019t see you, sir.\u2019 \n\u2018Strange how short-sighted being invisible can make you,\u2019 said \n\nDumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling. \n\u2018So,\u2019 said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor \n\nwith Harry, \u2018you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the \ndelights of the Mirror of Erised.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know it was called that, sir.\u2019 \n\u2018But I expect you\u2019ve realised by now what it does?\u2019 \n\u2018It \u2013 well \u2013 it shows me my family \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.\u2019 \n\u2018How did you know \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t need a cloak to become invisible,\u2019 said Dumbledore gen-\n\ntly. \u2018Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?\u2019 \nHarry shook his head. \n\u2018Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to \n\nuse the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would \nlook into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MIRROR  OF  ERISED 157 \n \n\n \n\nHarry thought. Then he said slowly, \u2018It shows us what we want \n... whatever we want ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes and no,\u2019 said Dumbledore quietly. \u2018It shows us nothing \nmore or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. \nYou, who have never known your family, see them standing \naround you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed \nby his brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of \nthem. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or \ntruth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they \nhave seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is \nreal or even possible. \n\n\u2018The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry, and \nI ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run across \nit, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on dreams \nand forget to live, remember that. Now, why don\u2019t you put that \nadmirable Cloak back on and get off to bed?\u2019 \n\nHarry stood up. \n\u2018Sir \u2013 Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?\u2019 \n\u2018Obviously, you\u2019ve just done so,\u2019 Dumbledore smiled. \u2018You may \n\nask me one more thing, however.\u2019 \n\u2018What do you see when you look in the Mirror?\u2019 \n\u2018I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks.\u2019 \nHarry stared. \n\u2018One can never have enough socks,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018Another \n\nChristmas has come and gone and I didn\u2019t get a single pair. People \nwill insist on giving me books.\u2019 \n\nIt was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that \nDumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he \nthought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a \npersonal question. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER THIRTEEN \u2014 \n \n\nNicolas Flamel \n \n\nDumbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the \nMirror of Erised again and for the rest of the Christmas holidays \nthe Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk. \nHarry wished he could forget what he\u2019d seen in the Mirror as \neasily, but he couldn\u2019t. He started having nightmares. Over and \nover again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of \ngreen light while a high voice cackled with laughter. \n\n\u2018You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you \nmad,\u2019 said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams. \n\nHermione, who came back the day before term started, took a \ndifferent view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea \nof Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a \nrow (\u2018If Filch had caught you!\u2019) and disappointment that he hadn\u2019t \nat least found out who Nicolas Flamel was. \n\nThey had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a \nlibrary book, even though Harry was still sure he\u2019d read the name \nsomewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming \nthrough books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had \neven less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had \nstarted again. \n\nWood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless \nrain that had replaced the snow couldn\u2019t dampen his spirits. The \nWeasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but \nHarry was on Wood\u2019s side. If they won their next match, against \nHufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Cham-\npionship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from \nwanting to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when \nhe was tired out after training. \n\nThen, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, \nWood gave the team a bit of bad news. He\u2019d just got very angry \n\n\n\n NICHOLAS  FLAMEL 159 \n \n\n \n\nwith the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pre-\ntending to fall off their brooms. \n\n\u2018Will you stop messing around!\u2019 he yelled. \u2018That\u2019s exactly the \nsort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this time, \nand he\u2019ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off \nGryffindor!\u2019 \n\nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \n\u2018Snape\u2019s refereeing?\u2019 he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \n\n\u2018When\u2019s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be \nfair if we might overtake Slytherin.\u2019 \n\nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \n\u2018It\u2019s not my fault,\u2019 said Wood. \u2018We\u2019ve just got to make sure we \n\nplay a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u2019 \nWhich was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another \n\nreason for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing \nQuidditch ... \n\nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to each other as usual at \nthe end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the \nGryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione \nplaying chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, \nsomething Harry and Ron thought was very good for her. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t talk to me for a moment,\u2019 said Ron when Harry sat down \nnext to him. \u2018I need to concen\u2013\u2019 He caught sight of Harry\u2019s face. \n\u2018What\u2019s the matter with you? You look terrible.\u2019 \n\nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the \nother two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch \nreferee. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t play,\u2019 said Hermione at once. \n\u2018Say you\u2019re ill,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Pretend to break your leg,\u2019 Hermione suggested. \n\u2018Really break your leg,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018There isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, \n\nGryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u2019 \nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How \n\nhe had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s \nguess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they \nrecognised at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to \nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \n\nEveryone fell about laughing except Hermione, who leapt up \nand performed the counter-curse. Neville\u2019s legs sprang apart and \n\n\n\n160 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nhe got to his feet, trembling. \n\u2018What happened?\u2019 Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit \n\nwith Harry and Ron. \n\u2018Malfoy,\u2019 said Neville shakily. \u2018I met him outside the library. He \n\nsaid he\u2019d been looking for someone to practise that on.\u2019 \n\u2018Go to Professor McGonagall!\u2019 Hermione urged Neville. \u2018Report \n\nhim!\u2019 \nNeville shook his head. \n\u2018I don\u2019t want more trouble,\u2019 he mumbled. \n\u2018You\u2019ve got to stand up to him, Neville!\u2019 said Ron. \u2018He\u2019s used to \n\nwalking all over people, but that\u2019s no reason to lie down in front \nof him and make it easier.\u2019 \n\n\u2018There\u2019s no need to tell me I\u2019m not brave enough to be in \nGryffindor, Malfoy\u2019s already done that,\u2019 Neville choked. \n\nHarry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate \nFrog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for \nChristmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might cry. \n\n\u2018You\u2019re worth twelve of Malfoy,\u2019 Harry said. \u2018The Sorting Hat \nchose you for Gryffindor, didn\u2019t it? And where\u2019s Malfoy? In stink-\ning Slytherin.\u2019 \n\nNeville\u2019s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the Frog. \n\u2018Thanks, Harry ... I think I\u2019ll go to bed ... D\u2019you want the card, \n\nyou collect them, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \nAs Neville walked away Harry looked at the Famous Wizard card. \n\u2018Dumbledore again,\u2019 he said. \u2018He was the first one I ever \u2013\u2019 \nHe gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked \n\nup at Ron and Hermione. \n\u2018I\u2019ve found him!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018I\u2019ve found Flamel! I told you I\u2019d \n\nread the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming \nhere \u2013 listen to this: \u201cProfessor Dumbledore is particularly famous \nfor his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the \ndiscovery of the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood and his work on \nalchemy with his partner, Nicolas Flamel\u201d!\u2019 \n\nHermione jumped to her feet. She hadn\u2019t looked so excited \nsince they\u2019d got back the marks for their very first piece of home-\nwork. \n\n\u2018Stay there!\u2019 she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls\u2019 \ndormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified \nlooks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her \narms. \n\n\n\n NICHOLAS  FLAMEL 161 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018I never thought to look in here!\u2019 she whispered excitedly. \u2018I got \nthis out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Light?\u2019 said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she\u2019d \nlooked something up, and started flicking frantically through the \npages, muttering to herself. \n\nAt last she found what she was looking for. \n\u2018I knew it! I knew it!\u2019 \n\u2018Are we allowed to speak yet?\u2019 said Ron grumpily. Hermione \n\nignored him. \n\u2018Nicolas Flamel,\u2019 she whispered dramatically, \u2018is the only known \n\nmaker of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone!\u2019 \nThis didn\u2019t have quite the effect she\u2019d expected. \n\u2018The what?\u2019 said Harry and Ron. \n\u2018Oh, honestly, don\u2019t you two read? Look \u2013 read that, there.\u2019 \nShe pushed the book towards them, and Harry and Ron read: \n \n\nThe ancient study of alchemy is concerned with \nmaking the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, a legendary \nsubstance with astonishing powers. The Stone \nwill transform any metal into pure gold. It also \nproduces the Elixir of Life, which will make \nthe drinker immortal. \n\nThere have been many reports of the Philosopher\u2019s \nStone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently \nin existence belongs to Mr Nicolas Flamel, the noted \nalchemist and opera-lover. Mr Flamel, who \ncelebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday \nlast year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, \nPerenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \n\n \n\u2018See?\u2019 said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. \u2018The dog \nmust be guarding Flamel\u2019s Philosopher\u2019s Stone! I bet he asked \nDumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they\u2019re friends and he \nknew someone was after it. That\u2019s why he wanted the Stone \nmoved out of Gringotts!\u2019 \n\n\u2018A stone that makes gold and stops you ever dying!\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018No wonder Snape\u2019s after it! Anyone would want it.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And no wonder we couldn\u2019t find Flamel in that Study of Recent \nDevelopments in Wizardry,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018He\u2019s not exactly recent if he\u2019s \nsix hundred and sixty-five, is he?\u2019 \n\n\n\n162 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nNext morning in Defence Against the Dark Arts, while copying \ndown different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron \nwere still discussing what they\u2019d do with a Philosopher\u2019s Stone if \nthey had one. It wasn\u2019t until Ron said he\u2019d buy his own Quidditch \nteam that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match. \n\nI\u2019m going to play,\u2019 he told Ron and Hermione. \u2018If I don\u2019t, all the \nSlytherins will think I\u2019m just too scared to face Snape. I\u2019ll show \nthem ... it\u2019ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Just as long as we\u2019re not wiping you off the pitch,\u2019 said \nHermione. \n\n* \nAs the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more \nnervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the \nteam weren\u2019t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in \nthe House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for \nnearly seven years, but would they be allowed to, with such a \nbiased referee? \n\nHarry didn\u2019t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he \nseemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, \nhe even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to \ncatch him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of \nweekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape pos-\nsibly know they\u2019d found out about the Philosopher\u2019s Stone? Harry \ndidn\u2019t see how he could \u2013 yet he sometimes had the horrible feel-\ning that Snape could read minds. \n\n* \nHarry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the chang-\ning rooms next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wonder-\ning whether they\u2019d ever see him alive again. This wasn\u2019t what \nyou\u2019d call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood\u2019s pep \ntalk as he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his \nNimbus Two Thousand. \n\nRon and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands \nnext to Neville, who couldn\u2019t understand why they looked so grim \nand worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the \nmatch. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been \nsecretly practising the Leg-Locker Curse. They\u2019d got the idea from \nMalfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape if he \nshowed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry. \n\n\u2018Now, don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s Locomotor Mortis,\u2019 Hermione muttered as \n\n\n\n NICHOLAS  FLAMEL 163 \n \n\n \n\nRon slipped his wand up his sleeve. \n\u2018I know,\u2019 Ron snapped. \u2018Don\u2019t nag.\u2019 \nBack in the changing room, Wood had taken Harry aside. \n\u2018Don\u2019t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early \n\ncapture of the Snitch it\u2019s now. Finish the game before Snape can \nfavour Hufflepuff too much.\u2019 \n\n\u2018The whole school\u2019s out there!\u2019 said Fred Weasley, peering out \nof the door. \u2018Even \u2013 blimey \u2013 Dumbledore\u2019s come to watch!\u2019 \n\nHarry\u2019s heart did a somersault. \n\u2018Dumbledore?\u2019 he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred \n\nwas right. There was no mistaking that silver beard. \nHarry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe. \n\nThere was simply no way that Snape would dare to try and hurt \nhim if Dumbledore was watching. \n\nPerhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams \nmarched on to the pitch, something that Ron noticed, too. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never seen Snape look so mean,\u2019 he told Hermione. \u2018Look \u2013 \nthey\u2019re off. Ouch!\u2019 \n\nSomeone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy. \n\u2018Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn\u2019t see you there.\u2019 \nMalfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle. \n\u2018Wonder how long Potter\u2019s going to stay on his broom this \n\ntime? Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?\u2019 \nRon didn\u2019t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty \n\nbecause George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who \nhad all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry, \nwho was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch. \n\n\u2018You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor \nteam?\u2019 said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded \nHufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. \u2018It\u2019s people they \nfeel sorry for. See, there\u2019s Potter, who\u2019s got no parents, then there\u2019s \nthe Weasleys, who\u2019ve got no money \u2013 you should be on the team, \nLongbottom, you\u2019ve got no brains.\u2019 \n\nNeville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy. \n\u2018I\u2019m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,\u2019 he stammered. \nMalfoy, Crabbe and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still \n\nnot daring to take his eyes from the game, said, \u2018You tell him, \nNeville.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Longbottom, if brains were gold you\u2019d be poorer than Weasley, \nand that\u2019s saying something.\u2019 \n\n\n\n164 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nRon\u2019s nerves were already stretched to breaking point with \nanxiety about Harry. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m warning you, Malfoy \u2013 one more word \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Ron!\u2019 said Hermione suddenly. \u2018Harry \u2013!\u2019 \n\u2018What? Where?\u2019 \nHarry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew \n\ngasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed \nfingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked towards the ground like a \nbullet. \n\n\u2018You\u2019re in luck, Weasley, Potter\u2019s obviously spotted some money \non the ground!\u2019 said Malfoy. \n\nRon snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron \nwas on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated, \nthen clambered over the back of his seat to help. \n\n\u2018Come on, Harry!\u2019 Hermione screamed, leaping on to her seat \nto watch as Harry sped straight at Snape \u2013 she didn\u2019t even notice \nMalfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and \nyelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe and \nGoyle. \n\nUp in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to \nsee something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches \u2013 \nnext second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in \ntriumph, the Snitch clasped in his hand. \n\nThe stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever \nremember the Snitch being caught so quickly. \n\n\u2018Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game\u2019s over! Harry\u2019s won! \nWe\u2019ve won! Gryffindor are in the lead!\u2019 shrieked Hermione, danc-\ning up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row \nin front. \n\nHarry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He couldn\u2019t \nbelieve it. He\u2019d done it \u2013 the game was over; it had barely lasted five \nminutes. As Gryffindors came spilling on to the pitch, he saw Snape \nland nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped \u2013 then Harry felt a hand \non his shoulder and looked up into Dumbledore\u2019s smiling face. \n\n\u2018Well done,\u2019 said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could \nhear. \u2018Nice to see you haven\u2019t been brooding about that mirror ... \nbeen keeping busy ... excellent ...\u2019 \n\nSnape spat bitterly on the ground. \n \n\n* \n\n\n\n NICHOLAS  FLAMEL 165 \n \n\n \n\nHarry left the changing room alone some time later, to take his \nNimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn\u2019t ever \nremember feeling happier. He\u2019d really done something to be proud \nof now \u2013 no one could say he was just a famous name any more. \nThe evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the \ndamp grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy \nblur: Gryffindors running to lift him on to their shoulders; Ron \nand Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheer-\ning through a heavy nosebleed. \n\nHarry had reached the shed. He leant against the wooden door \nand looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the \nsetting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He\u2019d done it, he\u2019d shown \nSnape ... \n\nAnd speaking of Snape ... \nA hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle. \n\nClearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible \ntowards the Forbidden Forest. Harry\u2019s victory faded from his mind \nas he watched. He recognised the figure\u2019s prowling walk. Snape, \nsneaking into the Forest while everyone else was at dinner \u2013 what \nwas going on? \n\nHarry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. \nGliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the Forest at a \nrun. He followed. \n\nThe trees were so thick he couldn\u2019t see where Snape had gone. \nHe flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of \ntrees until he heard voices. He glided towards them and landed \nnoiselessly in a towering beech tree. \n\nHe climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight \nto his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves. \n\nBelow, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn\u2019t alone. \nQuirrell was there, too. Harry couldn\u2019t make out the look on his \nface, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to \ncatch what they were saying. \n\n\u2018... d-don\u2019t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all p-\nplaces, Severus ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, I thought we\u2019d keep this private,\u2019 said Snape, his voice icy. \n\u2018Students aren\u2019t supposed to know about the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, \nafter all.\u2019 \n\nHarry leant forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape \ninterrupted him. \n\n\n\n166 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid\u2019s yet?\u2019 \n\u2018B-b-but Severus, I \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You don\u2019t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,\u2019 said Snape, taking \n\na step towards him. \n\u2018I-I don-t know what you \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You know perfectly well what I mean.\u2019 \nAn owl hooted loudly and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He \n\nsteadied himself in time to hear Snape say, \u2018\u2013 your little bit of \nhocus pocus. I\u2019m waiting.\u2019 \n\n\u2018B-but I d-d-don\u2019t \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Very well,\u2019 Snape cut in. \u2018We\u2019ll have another little chat soon, \n\nwhen you\u2019ve had time to think things over and decided where \nyour loyalties lie.\u2019 \n\nHe threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing. \nIt was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing \nquite still as though he was petrified. \n\n* \n\u2018Harry where have you been?\u2019 Hermione squeaked. \n\n\u2018We won! You won! We won!\u2019 shouted Ron, thumping Harry on \nthe back. \u2018And I gave Malfoy a black eye and Neville tried to take \non Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He\u2019s still out cold but \nMadam Pomfrey says he\u2019ll be all right \u2013 talk about showing \nSlytherin! Everyone\u2019s waiting for you in the common room, we\u2019re \nhaving a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from \nthe kitchens.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Never mind that now,\u2019 said Harry breathlessly. \u2018Let\u2019s find an \nempty room, you wait \u2019til you hear this ...\u2019 \n\nHe made sure Peeves wasn\u2019t inside before shutting the door \nbehind them, then he told them what he\u2019d seen and heard. \n\n\u2018So we were right, it is the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and Snape\u2019s try-\ning to force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how \nto get past Fluffy \u2013 and he said something about Quirrell\u2019s \u201chocus-\npocus\u201d \u2013 I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart \nfrom Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would \nhave done some anti-Dark Arts spell which Snape needs to break \nthrough \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018So you mean the Stone\u2019s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up \nto Snape?\u2019 said Hermione in alarm. \n\n\u2018It\u2019ll be gone by next Tuesday,\u2019 said Ron. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER FOURTEEN \u2014 \n \n\nNorbert the Norwegian \nRidgeback \n\n \n\nQuirrell, however, must have been braver than they\u2019d thought. In \nthe weeks that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thin-\nner, but it didn\u2019t look as though he\u2019d cracked yet. \n\nEvery time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron and \nHermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy \nwas still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual \nbad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe. \nWhenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an \nencouraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off \nfor laughing at Quirrell\u2019s stutter. \n\nHermione, however, had more on her mind than the \nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone. She had started drawing up revision time-\ntables and colour-coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\u2019t \nhave minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same. \n\n\u2018Hermione, the exams are ages away.\u2019 \n\u2018Ten weeks,\u2019 Hermione snapped. \u2018That\u2019s not ages, that\u2019s like a \n\nsecond to Nicolas Flamel.\u2019 \n\u2018But we\u2019re not six hundred years old,\u2019 Ron reminded her. \n\n\u2018Anyway, what are you revising for, you already know it all.\u2019 \n\u2018What am I revising for? Are you mad? You realise we need to \n\npass these exams to get into the second year? They\u2019re very impor-\ntant, I should have started studying a month ago, I don\u2019t know \nwhat\u2019s got into me ...\u2019 \n\nUnfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the \nsame lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them \nthat the Easter holidays weren\u2019t nearly as much fun as the \nChristmas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you \nreciting the twelve uses of dragon\u2019s blood or practising wand \n\n\n\n168 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nmovements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of \ntheir free time in the library with her, trying to get through all \ntheir extra work. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll never remember this,\u2019 Ron burst out one afternoon, throw-\ning down his quill and looking longingly out of the library \nwindow. It was the first really fine day they\u2019d had in months. The \nsky was a clear, forget-me-not blue and there was a feeling in the \nair of summer coming. \n\nHarry, who was looking up \u2018Dittany\u2019 in One Thousand Magical \nHerbs and Fungi, didn\u2019t look up until he heard Ron say, \u2018Hagrid! \nWhat are you doing in the library?\u2019 \n\nHagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back. \nHe looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat. \n\n\u2018Jus\u2019 lookin\u2019,\u2019 he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at \nonce. \u2018An\u2019 what\u2019re you lot up ter?\u2019 He looked suddenly suspicious. \n\u2018Yer not still lookin\u2019 fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,\u2019 said Ron impressively. \n\u2018And we know what that dog\u2019s guarding, it\u2019s a Philosopher\u2019s St\u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Shhhh!\u2019 Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was \nlistening. \u2018Don\u2019 go shoutin\u2019 about it, what\u2019s the matter with yeh?\u2019 \n\n\u2018There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of \nfact,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018about what\u2019s guarding the Stone apart from \nFluffy \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018SHHHH!\u2019 said Hagrid again. \u2018Listen \u2013 come an\u2019 see me later, I\u2019m \nnot promisin\u2019 I\u2019ll tell yeh anythin\u2019, mind, but don\u2019 go rabbitin\u2019 \nabout it in here, students aren\u2019 s\u2019posed ter know. They\u2019ll think \nI\u2019ve told yeh \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018See you later, then,\u2019 said Harry. \nHagrid shuffled off. \n\u2018What was he hiding behind his back?\u2019 said Hermione thought-\n\nfully. \n\u2018Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m going to see what section he was in,\u2019 said Ron, who\u2019d had \n\nenough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of \nbooks in his arms and slammed them down on the table. \n\n\u2018Dragons!\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Hagrid was looking up stuff about \ndragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and \nIreland; From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper\u2019s Guide.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Hagrid\u2019s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I \never met him,\u2019 said Harry. \n\n\n\n NORBERT  THE  NORWEGIAN  RIDGEBACK 169 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018But it\u2019s against our laws,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Dragon-breeding was out-\nlawed by the Warlocks\u2019 Convention of 1709, everyone knows \nthat. It\u2019s hard to stop Muggles noticing us if we\u2019re keeping dragons \nin the back garden \u2013 anyway, you can\u2019t tame dragons, it\u2019s danger-\nous. You should see the burns Charlie\u2019s got off wild ones in \nRomania.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But there aren\u2019t wild dragons in Britain?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Of course there are,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Common Welsh Green and \n\nHebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them \nup, I can tell you. Our lot have to keep putting spells on Muggles \nwho\u2019ve spotted them, to make them forget.\u2019 \n\n\u2018So what on earth\u2019s Hagrid up to?\u2019 said Hermione. \n* \n\nWhen they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper\u2019s hut an hour \nlater, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed. \nHagrid called, \u2018Who is it?\u2019 before he let them in and then shut the \ndoor quickly behind them. \n\nIt was stiflingly hot inside. Even though it was such a warm \nday, there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea \nand offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused. \n\n\u2018So \u2013 yeh wanted to ask me somethin\u2019?\u2019 \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Harry. There was no point beating about the bush. \n\n\u2018We were wondering if you could tell us what\u2019s guarding the \nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone apart from Fluffy.\u2019 \n\nHagrid frowned at him. \n\u2018O\u2019 course I can\u2019t,\u2019 he said. \u2018Number one, I don\u2019 know meself. \n\nNumber two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn\u2019 tell yeh if I \ncould. That Stone\u2019s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen \noutta Gringotts \u2013 I s\u2019pose yeh\u2019ve worked that out an\u2019 all? Beats me \nhow yeh even know abou\u2019 Fluffy.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do \nknow, you know everything that goes on round here,\u2019 said \nHermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid\u2019s beard twitched and \nthey could tell he was smiling. \u2018We only wondered who had done \nthe guarding, really.\u2019 Hermione went on. \u2018We wondered who \nDumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.\u2019 \n\nHagrid\u2019s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron \nbeamed at Hermione. \n\n\u2018Well, I don\u2019 s\u2019pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... let\u2019s see ... he \nborrowed Fluffy from me ... then some o\u2019 the teachers did \n\n\n\n170 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nenchantments ... Professor Sprout \u2013 Professor Flitwick \u2013 Professor \nMcGonagall \u2013\u2019 he ticked them off on his fingers, \u2018Professor \nQuirrell \u2013 an\u2019 Dumbledore himself did somethin\u2019, o\u2019 course. Hang \non, I\u2019ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Snape?\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah \u2013 yer not still on abou\u2019 that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped \n\nprotect the Stone, he\u2019s not about ter steal it.\u2019 \nHarry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he \n\nwas. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have \nbeen easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He \nprobably knew everything \u2013 except, it seemed, Quirrell\u2019s spell and \nhow to get past Fluffy. \n\n\u2018You\u2019re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren\u2019t \nyou, Hagrid?\u2019 said Harry anxiously. \u2018And you wouldn\u2019t tell anyone, \nwould you? Not even one of the teachers?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Not a soul knows except me an\u2019 Dumbledore,\u2019 said Hagrid \nproudly. \n\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s something,\u2019 Harry muttered to the others. \u2018Hagrid, \ncan we have a window open? I\u2019m boiling.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Can\u2019t, Harry, sorry,\u2019 said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at \nthe fire. Harry looked at it, too. \n\n\u2018Hagrid \u2013 what\u2019s that?\u2019 \nBut he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, \n\nunderneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg. \n\u2018Ah,\u2019 said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard. \u2018That\u2019s \u2013 er ...\u2019 \n\u2018Where did you get it, Hagrid?\u2019 said Ron, crouching over the \n\nfire to get a closer look at the egg. \u2018It must\u2019ve cost you a fortune.\u2019 \n\u2018Won it,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018Las\u2019 night. I was down in the village \n\nhavin\u2019 a few drinks an\u2019 got into a game o\u2019 cards with a stranger. \nThink he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But what are you going to do with it when it\u2019s hatched?\u2019 said \nHermione. \n\n\u2018Well, I\u2019ve bin doin\u2019 some readin\u2019,\u2019 said Hagrid, pulling a large \nbook from under his pillow. \u2018Got this outta the library \u2013 Dragon-\nBreeding for Pleasure and Profit \u2013 it\u2019s a bit outta date, o\u2019 course, but \nit\u2019s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, \u2019cause their mothers \nbreathe on \u2019em, see, an\u2019 when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o\u2019 \nbrandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An\u2019 see here \u2013 \nhow ter recognise diff\u2019rent eggs \u2013 what I got there\u2019s a Norwegian \nRidgeback. They\u2019re rare, them.\u2019 \n\n\n\n NORBERT  THE  NORWEGIAN  RIDGEBACK 171 \n \n\n \n\nHe looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn\u2019t. \n\u2018Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,\u2019 she said. \nBut Hagrid wasn\u2019t listening. He was humming merrily as he \n\nstoked the fire. \n* \n\nSo now they had something else to worry about: what might hap-\npen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon \nin his hut. \n\n\u2018Wonder what it\u2019s like to have a peaceful life,\u2019 Ron sighed, as \nevening after evening they struggled through all the extra home-\nwork they were getting. Hermione had now started making revi-\nsion timetables for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them mad. \n\nThen, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note \nfrom Hagrid. He had written only two words: It\u2019s hatching. \n\nRon wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut. \nHermione wouldn\u2019t hear of it. \n\n\u2018Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a \ndragon hatching?\u2019 \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got lessons, we\u2019ll get into trouble, and that\u2019s nothing to \nwhat Hagrid\u2019s going to be in when someone finds out what he\u2019s \ndoing \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Shut up!\u2019 Harry whispered. \nMalfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to \n\nlisten. How much had he heard? Harry didn\u2019t like the look on \nMalfoy\u2019s face at all. \n\nRon and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology, and in the \nend, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid\u2019s with the other two \nduring morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at \nthe end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at \nonce and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the Forest. \nHagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s nearly out.\u2019 He ushered them inside. \nThe egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. \n\nSomething was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming \nfrom it. \n\nThey all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with \nbated breath. \n\nAll at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. \nThe baby dragon flopped on to the table. It wasn\u2019t exactly pretty; \nHarry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny \n\n\n\n172 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwings were huge compared to its skinny jet body and it had a long \nsnout with wide nostrils, stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. \n\nIt sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n\u2018Isn\u2019t he beautiful?\u2019 Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand \n\nto stroke the dragon\u2019s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing \npointed fangs. \n\n\u2018Bless him, look, he knows his mummy!\u2019 said Hagrid. \n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 said Hermione, \u2018how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks \n\ngrow, exactly?\u2019 \nHagrid was about to answer when the colour suddenly drained \n\nfrom his face \u2013 he leapt to his feet and ran to the window. \n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019 \n\u2018Someone was lookin\u2019 through the gap in the curtains \u2013 it\u2019s a \n\nkid \u2013 he\u2019s runnin\u2019 back up ter the school.\u2019 \nHarry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance \n\nthere was no mistaking him. \nMalfoy had seen the dragon. \n\n* \nSomething about the smile lurking on Malfoy\u2019s face during the \nnext week made Harry, Ron and Hermione very nervous. They \nspent most of their free time in Hagrid\u2019s darkened hut, trying to \nreason with him. \n\n\u2018Just let him go,\u2019 Harry urged. \u2018Set him free.\u2019 \n\u2018I can\u2019t,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018He\u2019s too little. He\u2019d die.\u2019 \nThey looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length \n\nin just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn\u2019t \nbeen doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keep-\ning him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken \nfeathers all over the floor. \n\n\u2018I\u2019ve decided to call him Norbert,\u2019 said Hagrid, looking at the \ndragon with misty eyes. \u2018He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! \nNorbert! Where\u2019s Mummy?\u2019 \n\n\u2018He\u2019s lost his marbles,\u2019 Ron muttered in Harry\u2019s ear. \n\u2018Hagrid,\u2019 said Harry loudly, \u2018give it a fortnight and Norbert\u2019s \n\ngoing to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to \nDumbledore at any moment.\u2019 \n\nHagrid bit his lip. \n\u2018I \u2013 I know I can\u2019t keep him for ever, but I can\u2019t jus\u2019 dump him, \n\nI can\u2019t.\u2019 \nHarry suddenly turned to Ron. \n\n\n\n NORBERT  THE  NORWEGIAN  RIDGEBACK 173 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Charlie,\u2019 he said. \n\u2018You\u2019re losing it, too,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018I\u2019m Ron, remember?\u2019 \n\u2018No \u2013 Charlie \u2013 your brother Charlie. In Romania. Studying \n\ndragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of \nhim and then put him back in the wild!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Brilliant!\u2019 said Ron. \u2018How about it, Hagrid?\u2019 \nAnd in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to \n\nCharlie to ask him. \n* \n\nThe following week dragged by. Wednesday night found \nHermione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after \neveryone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just \nchimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron \nappeared out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry\u2019s Invisibility \nCloak. He had been down at Hagrid\u2019s hut, helping him feed \nNorbert, who was now eating dead rats by the crate. \n\n\u2018It bit me!\u2019 he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped \nin a bloody handkerchief. \u2018I\u2019m not going to be able to hold a quill \nfor a week. I tell you, that dragon\u2019s the most horrible animal I\u2019ve \never met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you\u2019d think it was \na fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for \nfrightening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.\u2019 \n\nThere was a tap on the dark window. \n\u2018It\u2019s Hedwig!\u2019 said Harry, hurrying to let her in. \u2018She\u2019ll have \n\nCharlie\u2019s answer!\u2019 \nThe three of them put their heads together to read the note. \n \nDear Ron, \n\nHow are you? Thanks for the letter \u2013 I\u2019d he glad to take  \nthe Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won\u2019t be easy getting  \nhim here. I think the best thing will be to send him over  \nwith some friends of mine who are coming to visit me  \nnext week. Trouble is, they mustn\u2019t be seen carrying  \nan illegal dragon. \n\nCould you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at  \nmidnight on Saturday? They can meet you there and  \ntake him away while it\u2019s still dark. \n\nSend me an answer as soon as possible. \nLove, \nCharlie \n\n\n\n174 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nThey looked at each other. \n\u2018We\u2019ve got the Invisibility Cloak,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018It shouldn\u2019t be too \n\ndifficult \u2013 I think the Cloak\u2019s big enough to cover two of us and \nNorbert.\u2019 \n\nIt was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other \ntwo agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert \u2013 and Malfoy. \n\n* \nThere was a hitch. By next morning, Ron\u2019s bitten hand had \nswollen to twice its usual size. He didn\u2019t know whether it was safe \nto go to Madam Pomfrey \u2013 would she recognise a dragon bite? By \nthe afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a \nnasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert\u2019s fangs were poiso-\nnous. \n\nHarry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end \nof the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s not just my hand,\u2019 he whispered, \u2018although that feels like it\u2019s \nabout to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to bor-\nrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at \nme. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me \u2013 I\u2019ve told \nher it was a dog but I don\u2019t think she believes me \u2013 I shouldn\u2019t \nhave hit him at the Quidditch match, that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing this.\u2019 \n\nHarry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down. \n\u2018It\u2019ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,\u2019 said Hermione, but \n\nthis didn\u2019t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright \nand broke into a sweat. \n\n\u2018Midnight on Saturday!\u2019 he said in a hoarse voice. \u2018Oh no \u2013 oh \nno \u2013 I\u2019ve just remembered \u2013 Charlie\u2019s letter was in that book \nMalfoy took, he\u2019s going to know we\u2019re getting rid of Norbert.\u2019 \n\nHarry and Hermione didn\u2019t get a chance to answer. Madam \nPomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying \nRon needed sleep. \n\n* \n\u2018It\u2019s too late to change the plan now,\u2019 Harry told Hermione. \u2018We \nhaven\u2019t got time to send Charlie another owl and this could be \nour only chance to get rid of Norbert. We\u2019ll have to risk it. And \nwe have got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn\u2019t know about \nthat.\u2019 \n\nThey found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a ban-\ndaged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window \nto talk to them. \n\n\n\n NORBERT  THE  NORWEGIAN  RIDGEBACK 175 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018I won\u2019t let you in,\u2019 he puffed. \u2018Norbert\u2019s at a tricky stage \u2013 noth-\nin\u2019 I can\u2019t handle.\u2019 \n\nWhen they told him about Charlie\u2019s letter, his eyes filled with \ntears, although that might have been because Norbert had just \nbitten him on the leg. \n\n\u2018Aargh! It\u2019s all right, he only got my boot \u2013 jus\u2019 playin\u2019 \u2013 he\u2019s \nonly a baby, after all.\u2019 \n\nThe baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows \nrattle. Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle, feeling \nSaturday couldn\u2019t come quickly enough. \n\n* \nThey would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for \nhim to say goodbye to Norbert if they hadn\u2019t been so worried \nabout what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night and \nthey were a bit late arriving at Hagrid\u2019s hut because they\u2019d had to \nwait for Peeves to get out of their way in the Entrance Hall, where \nhe\u2019d been playing tennis against the wall. \n\nHagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate. \n\u2018He\u2019s got lots o\u2019 rats an\u2019 some brandy fer the journey,\u2019 said \n\nHagrid in a muffled voice. \u2018An\u2019 I\u2019ve packed his teddy bear in case \nhe gets lonely.\u2019 \n\nFrom inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to \nHarry as though teddy was having his head torn off. \n\n\u2018Bye-bye, Norbert!\u2019 Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione cov-\nered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath \nit themselves. \u2018Mummy will never forget you!\u2019 \n\nHow they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they \nnever knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the \nmarble staircase in the Entrance Hall and along the dark corri-\ndors. Up another staircase, then another \u2013 even one of Harry\u2019s \nshort cuts didn\u2019t make the work much easier. \n\n\u2018Nearly there!\u2019 Harry panted as they reached the corridor \nbeneath the tallest tower. \n\nThen a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost \ndrop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they \nshrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two \npeople grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared. \n\nProfessor McGonagall, in a tartan dressing-gown and a hairnet, \nhad Malfoy by the ear. \n\n\u2018Detention!\u2019 she shouted. \u2018And twenty points from Slytherin! \n\n\n\n176 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nWandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You don\u2019t understand, Professor, Harry Potter\u2019s coming \u2013 he\u2019s \n\ngot a dragon!\u2019 \n\u2018What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on \u2013 I \n\nshall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!\u2019 \nThe steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the \n\neasiest thing in the world after that. Not until they\u2019d stepped out \ninto the cold night air did they throw off the Cloak, glad to be \nable to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig. \n\n\u2018Malfoy\u2019s got detention! I could sing!\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Harry advised her. \nChuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about \n\nin his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came \nswooping down out of the darkness. \n\nCharlie\u2019s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and \nHermione the harness they\u2019d rigged up, so they could suspend \nNorbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into \nit and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and \nthanked them very much. \n\nAt last, Norbert was going ... going ... gone. \nThey slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as \n\nlight as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more \ndragon \u2013 Malfoy in detention \u2013 what could spoil their happiness? \n\nThe answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they \nstepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the \ndarkness. \n\n\u2018Well, well, well,\u2019 he whispered, \u2018we are in trouble.\u2019 \nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER FIFTEEN \u2014 \n \n\nThe Forbidden Forest \n \n\nThings couldn\u2019t have been worse. \nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study on the \n\nfirst floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word to \neach other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis and wild \ncover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each \nmore feeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t see how they were going to \nget out of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they \nhave been so stupid as to forget the Cloak? There was no reason \non earth that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being \nout of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let \nalone being up the tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-\nbounds except for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak \nand they might as well be packing their bags already. \n\nHad Harry thought that things couldn\u2019t have been worse? He \nwas wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was lead-\ning Neville. \n\n\u2018Harry!\u2019 Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. \u2018I \nwas trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was \ngoing to catch you, he said you had a drag\u2013\u2019 \n\nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but \nProfessor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe \nfire than Norbert as she towered over the three of them. \n\n\u2018I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr Filch says you \nwere up the astronomy tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. \nExplain yourselves.\u2019 \n\nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a teach-\ner\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \n\n\u2018I think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u2019 said \nProfessor McGonagall. \u2018It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You \nfed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying \n\n\n\n178 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nto get him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I \nsuppose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story \nand believed it, too?\u2019 \n\nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tried to tell him without words \nthat this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and \nhurt. Poor, blundering Neville \u2013 Harry knew what it must have \ncost him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall. \u2018Four students out \nof bed in one night! I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing before! You, \nMiss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr \nPotter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All \nthree of you will receive detentions \u2013 yes, you too, Mr \nLongbottom, nothing gives you the right to walk around school at \nnight, especially these days, it\u2019s very dangerous \u2013 and fifty points \nwill be taken from Gryffindor.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Fifty?\u2019 Harry gasped \u2013 they would lose the lead, the lead he\u2019d \nwon in the last Quidditch match. \n\n\u2018Fifty points each,\u2019 said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily \nthrough her long pointed nose. \n\n\u2018Professor \u2013 please \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You can\u2019t \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t tell me what I can and can\u2019t do, Potter. Now get back to \n\nbed, all of you. I\u2019ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor \nstudents.\u2019 \n\nA hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last \nplace. In one night, they\u2019d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had \nfor the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped \nout of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this? \n\nHarry didn\u2019t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into \nhis pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn\u2019t think of \nanything to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, \nwas dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of \nGryffindor found out what they\u2019d done? \n\nAt first, Gryffindors passing the giant hour-glasses that record-\ned the house points next day thought there\u2019d been a mistake. How \ncould they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer than \nyesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter, the \nfamous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had \nlost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first-\nyears. \n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 179 \n \n\n \n\nFrom being one of the most popular and admired people at the \nschool, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and \nHufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to \nsee Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people \npointed and didn\u2019t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted \nhim. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past \nthem, whistling and cheering, \u2018Thanks Potter, we owe you one!\u2019 \n\nOnly Ron stood by him. \n\u2018They\u2019ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost \n\nloads of points in all the time they\u2019ve been here, and people still \nlike them.\u2019 \n\n\u2018They\u2019ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go, \nthough, have they?\u2019 said Harry miserably. \n\n\u2018Well \u2013 no,\u2019 Ron admitted. \nIt was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to him-\n\nself not to meddle in things that weren\u2019t his business from now \non. He\u2019d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so \nashamed of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign \nfrom the Quidditch team. \n\n\u2018Resign?\u2019 Wood thundered. \u2018What good\u2019ll that do? How are we \ngoing to get any points back if we can\u2019t win at Quidditch?\u2019 \n\nBut even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team \nwouldn\u2019t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak \nabout him, they called him \u2018the Seeker\u2019. \n\nHermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn\u2019t have as \nbad a time as Harry, because they weren\u2019t as well known, but \nnobody would speak to them either. Hermione had stopped draw-\ning attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and work-\ning in silence. \n\nHarry was almost glad that the exams weren\u2019t far away. All the \nrevision he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron and \nHermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying \nto remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms \nand spells off by heart, memorise the dates of magical discoveries \nand goblin rebellions ... \n\nThen, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry\u2019s \nnew resolution not to interfere in anything that didn\u2019t concern \nhim was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library \non his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a \nclassroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice. \n\n\n\n180 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018No \u2013 no \u2013 not again, please \u2013\u2019 \nIt sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry \n\nmoved closer. \n\u2018All right \u2013 all right \u2013\u2019 he heard Quirrell sob. \nNext second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom, \n\nstraightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he \nwas about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn\u2019t think \nQuirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell\u2019s footsteps \nhad disappeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, \nbut a door stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway \ntowards it before he remembered what he\u2019d promised himself \nabout not meddling. \n\nAll the same, he\u2019d have gambled twelve Philosopher\u2019s Stones \nthat Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just \nheard, Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step \u2013 \nQuirrell seemed to have given in at last. \n\nHarry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing \nRon on Astronomy. Harry told them what he\u2019d heard. \n\n\u2018Snape\u2019s done it, then!\u2019 said Ron. \u2018If Quirrell\u2019s told him how to \nbreak his Anti-Dark Force spell \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018There\u2019s still Fluffy, though,\u2019 said Hermione. \n\u2018Maybe Snape\u2019s found out how to get past him without asking \n\nHagrid,\u2019 said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books surround-\ning them. \u2018I bet there\u2019s a book somewhere in here, telling you how \nto get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?\u2019 \n\nThe light of adventure was kindling again in Ron\u2019s eyes, but \nHermione answered before Harry could. \n\n\u2018Go to Dumbledore. That\u2019s what we should have done ages ago. \nIf we try anything ourselves we\u2019ll be thrown out for sure.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But we\u2019ve got no proof!\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Quirrell\u2019s too scared to \nback us up. Snape\u2019s only got to say he doesn\u2019t know how the troll \ngot in at Hallowe\u2019en and that he was nowhere near the third floor \n\u2013 who do you think they\u2019ll believe, him or us? It\u2019s not exactly a \nsecret we hate him, Dumbledore\u2019ll think we made it up to get him \nsacked. Filch wouldn\u2019t help us if his life depended on it, he\u2019s too \nfriendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the \nbetter, he\u2019ll think. And don\u2019t forget, we\u2019re not supposed to know \nabout the Stone or Fluffy. That\u2019ll take a lot of explaining.\u2019 \n\nHermione looked convinced, but Ron didn\u2019t. \n\u2018If we just do a bit of poking around \u2013\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 181 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry flatly, \u2018we\u2019ve done enough poking around.\u2019 \nHe pulled a map of Jupiter towards him and started to learn the \n\nnames of its moons. \n* \n\nThe following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione \nand Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same: \n\n \nYour detention will take place at eleven o\u2019clock tonight. Meet \n\nMr Filch in the Entrance Hall. \nProf. M. McGonagall \n\n \nHarry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furore \nover the points they\u2019d lost. He half expected Hermione to com-\nplain that this was a whole night of revision lost, but she didn\u2019t say \na word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they\u2019d got. \n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock that night they said goodbye to Ron in the \ncommon room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville. \nFilch was already there \u2013 and so was Malfoy. Harry had also for-\ngotten that Malfoy had got a detention, too. \n\n\u2018Follow me,\u2019 said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them out-\nside. \u2018I bet you\u2019ll think twice about breaking a school rule again, \nwon\u2019t you, eh?\u2019 he continued, leering at them. \u2018Oh yes ... hard \nwork and pain are the best teachers if you ask me ... It\u2019s just a pity \nthey let the old punishments die out ... hang you by your wrists \nfrom the ceiling for a few days, I\u2019ve got the chains still in my \noffice, keep \u2019em well oiled in case they\u2019re ever needed ... Right, off \nwe go, and don\u2019t think of running off, now, it\u2019ll be worse for you if \nyou do.\u2019 \n\nThey marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniff-\ning. Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It \nmust be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn\u2019t be sounding \nso delighted. \n\nThe moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept \nthrowing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted \nwindows of Hagrid\u2019s hut. Then they heard a distant shout. \n\n\u2018Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.\u2019 \nHarry\u2019s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid \n\nit wouldn\u2019t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, \nbecause Filch said, \u2018I suppose you think you\u2019ll be enjoying your-\nself with that oaf? Well, think again, boy \u2013 it\u2019s into the Forest \n\n\n\n182 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nyou\u2019re going and I\u2019m much mistaken if you\u2019ll all come out in one \npiece.\u2019 \n\nAt this, Neville let out a little moan and Malfoy stopped dead in \nhis tracks. \n\n\u2018The Forest?\u2019 he repeated, and he didn\u2019t sound quite as cool as \nusual. \u2018We can\u2019t go in there at night \u2013 there\u2019s all sorts of things in \nthere \u2013 werewolves, I heard.\u2019 \n\nNeville clutched the sleeve of Harry\u2019s robe and made a choking \nnoise. \n\n\u2018That\u2019s your lookout, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Filch, his voice cracking with \nglee. \u2018Should\u2019ve thought of them werewolves before you got in \ntrouble, shouldn\u2019t you?\u2019 \n\nHagrid came striding towards them out of the dark, Fang at his \nheel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows \nhung over his shoulder. \n\n\u2018Abou\u2019 time,\u2019 he said. \u2018I bin waitin\u2019 fer half an hour already. All \nright, Harry, Hermione?\u2019 \n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,\u2019 said Filch coldly, \n\u2018they\u2019re here to be punished, after all.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s why yer late, is it?\u2019 said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. \u2018Bin \nlecturin\u2019 them, eh? \u2019Snot your place ter do that. Yeh\u2019ve done yer \nbit, I\u2019ll take over from here.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I\u2019ll be back at dawn,\u2019 said Filch, \u2018for what\u2019s left of them,\u2019 he \nadded nastily, and he turned and started back towards the castle, \nhis lamp bobbing away in the darkness. \n\nMalfoy now turned to Hagrid. \n\u2018I\u2019m not going in that Forest,\u2019 he said, and Harry was pleased to \n\nhear the note of panic in his voice. \n\u2018Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,\u2019 said Hagrid fiercely. \n\n\u2018Yeh\u2019ve done wrong an\u2019 now yeh\u2019ve got ter pay fer it.\u2019 \n\u2018But this is servant stuff, it\u2019s not for students to do. I thought \n\nwe\u2019d be writing lines or something. If my father knew I was doing \nthis, he\u2019d \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018\u2013 tell yer that\u2019s how it is at Hogwarts,\u2019 Hagrid growled. \u2018Writin\u2019 \nlines! What good\u2019s that ter anyone? Yeh\u2019ll do summat useful or \nyeh\u2019ll get out. If yeh think yer father\u2019d rather you were expelled, \nthen get back off ter the castle an\u2019 pack. Go on!\u2019 \n\nMalfoy didn\u2019t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously but then \ndropped his gaze. \n\n\u2018Right then,\u2019 said Hagrid, \u2018now, listen carefully, \u2019cause it\u2019s dan-\n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 183 \n \n\n \n\ngerous what we\u2019re gonna do tonight an\u2019 I don\u2019 want no one takin\u2019 \nrisks. Follow me over here a moment.\u2019 \n\nHe led them to the very edge of the Forest. Holding his lamp \nup high he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that dis-\nappeared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair \nas they looked into the Forest. \n\n\u2018Look there,\u2019 said Hagrid, \u2018see that stuff shinin\u2019 on the ground? \nSilvery stuff? That\u2019s unicorn blood. There\u2019s a unicorn in there bin \nhurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found \none dead last Wednesday. We\u2019re gonna try an\u2019 find the poor thing. \nWe might have ter put it out of its misery.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?\u2019 said \nMalfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice. \n\n\u2018There\u2019s nothin\u2019 that lives in the Forest that\u2019ll hurt yeh if yer \nwith me or Fang,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018An\u2019 keep ter the path. Right, now, \nwe\u2019re gonna split inter two parties an\u2019 follow the trail in diff\u2019rent \ndirections. There\u2019s blood all over the place, it must\u2019ve bin stag-\ngerin\u2019 around since last night at least.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I want Fang,\u2019 said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang\u2019s long teeth. \n\u2018All right, but I warn yeh, he\u2019s a coward,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018So me, \n\nHarry an\u2019 Hermione\u2019ll go one way an\u2019 Draco, Neville an\u2019 Fang\u2019ll go \nthe other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we\u2019ll send up green \nsparks, right? Get yer wands out an\u2019 practise now \u2013 that\u2019s it \u2013 an\u2019 if \nanyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an\u2019 we\u2019ll all come an\u2019 \nfind yeh \u2013 so, be careful \u2013 let\u2019s go.\u2019 \n\nThe Forest was black and silent. A little way into it they \nreached a fork in the earth path and Harry, Hermione and Hagrid \ntook the left path while Malfoy, Neville and Fang took the right. \n\nThey walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now \nand then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot \nof silver blue blood on the fallen leaves. \n\nHarry saw that Hagrid looked very worried. \n\u2018Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?\u2019 Harry asked. \n\u2018Not fast enough,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018It\u2019s not easy ter catch a unicorn, \n\nthey\u2019re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt \nbefore.\u2019 \n\nThey walked past a mossy tree-stump. Harry could hear run-\nning water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There \nwere still spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding \npath. \n\n\n\n184 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018You all right, Hermione?\u2019 Hagrid whispered. \u2018Don\u2019 worry, it \ncan\u2019t\u2019ve gone far if it\u2019s this badly hurt an\u2019 then we\u2019ll be able ter \u2013 \nGET BEHIND THAT TREE!\u2019 \n\nHagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the \npath behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it \ninto his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them lis-\ntened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it \nsounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squint-\ning up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded \naway. \n\n\u2018I knew it,\u2019 he murmured. \u2018There\u2019s summat in here that shouldn\u2019 \nbe.\u2019 \n\n\u2018A werewolf?\u2019 Harry suggested. \n\u2018That wasn\u2019 no werewolf an\u2019 it wasn\u2019 no unicorn, neither,\u2019 said \n\nHagrid grimly. \u2018Right, follow me, but careful, now.\u2019 \nThey walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound. \n\nSuddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved. \n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Hagrid called. \u2018Show yerself \u2013 I\u2019m armed!\u2019 \nAnd into the clearing came \u2013 was it a man, or a horse? To the \n\nwaist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse\u2019s \ngleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and \nHermione\u2019s jaws dropped. \n\n\u2018Oh, it\u2019s you, Ronan,\u2019 said Hagrid in relief. \u2018How are yeh?\u2019 \nHe walked forward and shook the centaur\u2019s hand. \n\u2018Good evening to you, Hagrid,\u2019 said Ronan. He had a deep, \n\nsorrowful voice. \u2018Were you going to shoot me?\u2019 \n\u2018Can\u2019t be too careful, Ronan,\u2019 said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. \n\n\u2018There\u2019s summat bad loose in this Forest. This is Harry Potter an\u2019 \nHermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An\u2019 this \nis Ronan, you two. He\u2019s a centaur.\u2019 \n\n\u2018We\u2019d noticed,\u2019 said Hermione faintly. \n\u2018Good evening,\u2019 said Ronan. \u2018Students, are you? And do you \n\nlearn much, up at the school?\u2019 \n\u2018Erm \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018A bit,\u2019 said Hermione timidly. \n\u2018A bit. Well, that\u2019s something.\u2019 Ronan sighed. He flung back his \n\nhead and stared at the sky. \u2018Mars is bright tonight.\u2019 \n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Hagrid, glancing up too. \u2018Listen, I\u2019m glad we\u2019ve run \n\ninter yeh, Ronan, \u2019cause there\u2019s a unicorn bin hurt \u2013 you seen any-\nthin\u2019?\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 185 \n \n\n \n\nRonan didn\u2019t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly \nupwards, then sighed again. \n\n\u2018Always the innocent are the first victims,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it has \nbeen for ages past, so it is now.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Hagrid, \u2018but have yeh seen anythin\u2019, Ronan? \nAnythin\u2019 unusual?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Mars is bright tonight,\u2019 Ronan repeated while Hagrid watched \nhim impatiently. \u2018Unusually bright.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yeah, but I was meanin\u2019 anythin\u2019 unusual a bit nearer home,\u2019 \nsaid Hagrid. \u2018So yeh haven\u2019t noticed anythin\u2019 strange?\u2019 \n\nYet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, \u2018The \nForest hides many secrets.\u2019 \n\nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his \nbow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and \n-bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan. \n\n\u2018Hullo, Bane,\u2019 said Hagrid. \u2018All right?\u2019 \n\u2018Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u2019 \n\u2018Well enough. Look, I\u2019ve jus\u2019 bin askin\u2019 Ronan, you seen any-\n\nthin\u2019 odd in here lately? Only there\u2019s a unicorn bin injured \u2013 \nwould yeh know anythin\u2019 about it?\u2019 \n\nBane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skywards. \n\u2018Mars is bright tonight,\u2019 he said simply. \n\u2018We\u2019ve heard,\u2019 said Hagrid grumpily. \u2018Well, if either of you do \n\nsee anythin\u2019, let me know, won\u2019t yeh? We\u2019ll be off, then.\u2019 \nHarry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring \n\nover their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked \ntheir view. \n\n\u2018Never,\u2019 said Hagrid irritably, \u2018try an\u2019 get a straight answer out of \na centaur. Ruddy star-gazers. Not interested in anythin\u2019 closer\u2019n \nthe moon.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Are there many of them in here?\u2019 asked Hermione. \n\u2018Oh, a fair few ... Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but \n\nthey\u2019re good enough about turnin\u2019 up if ever I want a word. \nThey\u2019re deep, mind, centaurs ... they know things ... jus\u2019 don\u2019 let \non much.\u2019 \n\n\u2018D\u2019you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that \n\nwas what\u2019s bin killin\u2019 the unicorns \u2013 never heard anythin\u2019 like it \nbefore.\u2019 \n\nThey walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept \n\n\n\n186 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nlooking nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they \nwere being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his \ncrossbow with them. They had just passed a bend in the path \nwhen Hermione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm. \n\n\u2018Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!\u2019 \n\u2018You two wait here!\u2019 Hagrid shouted. \u2018Stay on the path, I\u2019ll come \n\nback for yeh!\u2019 \nThey heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and \n\nstood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn\u2019t hear \nanything but the rustling of leaves around them. \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t think they\u2019ve been hurt, do you?\u2019 whispered \nHermione. \n\n\u2018I don\u2019t care if Malfoy has, but if something\u2019s got Neville ... It\u2019s \nour fault he\u2019s here in the first place.\u2019 \n\nThe minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. \nHarry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every \ncracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? \n\nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. \nMalfoy, Neville and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. \nMalfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed \nhim for a joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \n\n\u2018We\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two \nwere makin\u2019. Right, we\u2019re changin\u2019 groups \u2013 Neville, you stay with \nme an\u2019 Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an\u2019 this idiot. I\u2019m \nsorry,\u2019 Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, \u2018but he\u2019ll have a harder \ntime frightenin\u2019 you, an\u2019 we\u2019ve gotta get this done.\u2019 \n\nSo Harry set off into the heart of the Forest with Malfoy and \nFang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into \nthe Forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow \nbecause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed \nto be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, \nas though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain \nclose by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled \nbranches of an ancient oak. \n\n\u2018Look \u2013\u2019 he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. \nSomething bright white was gleaming on the ground. They \n\ninched closer. \nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never \n\nseen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long slender legs were \nstuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was \n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 187 \n \n\n \n\nspread pearly white on the dark leaves. \nHarry had taken one step towards it when a slithering sound \n\nmade him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clear-\ning quivered ... Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came \ncrawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy \nand Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the uni-\ncorn, it lowered its head over the wound in the animal\u2019s side, and \nbegan to drink its blood. \n\n\u2018AAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u2019 \nMalfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \u2013 so did Fang. The \n\nhooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry \u2013 unicorn \nblood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came \nswiftly towards him \u2013 he couldn\u2019t move for fear. \n\nThen a pain pierced his head like he\u2019d never felt before, it was \nas though his scar was on fire \u2013 half-blinded, he staggered back-\nwards. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something \njumped clean over him, charging at the figure. \n\nThe pain in Harry\u2019s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took \na minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had gone. \nA centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one \nlooked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino body. \n\n\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet. \n\u2018Yes \u2013 thank you \u2013 what was that?\u2019 \nThe centaur didn\u2019t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like \n\npale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on \nthe scar which stood out, livid, on Harry\u2019s forehead. \n\n\u2018You are the Potter boy,\u2019 he said. \u2018You had better get back to \nHagrid. The Forest is not safe at this time \u2013 especially for you. \nCan you ride? It will be quicker this way. \n\n\u2018My name is Firenze,\u2019 he added, as he lowered himself on to his \nfront legs so that Harry could clamber on to his back. \n\nThere was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other \nside of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the \ntrees, their flanks heaving and sweaty. \n\n\u2018Firenze!\u2019 Bane thundered. \u2018What are you doing? You have a \nhuman on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common \nmule?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Do you realise who this is?\u2019 said Firenze. \u2018This is the Potter \nboy. The quicker he leaves this Forest, the better.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What have you been telling him?\u2019 growled Bane. \u2018Remember, \n\n\n\n188 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nFirenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. \nHave we not read what is to come in the movements of the plan-\nets?\u2019 \n\nRonan pawed the ground nervously. \n\u2018I\u2019m sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best,\u2019 he said, in \n\nhis gloomy voice. \nBane kicked his back legs in anger. \n\u2018For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are con-\n\ncerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run \naround like donkeys after stray humans in our Forest!\u2019 \n\nFirenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that \nHarry had to grab his shoulders to stay on. \n\n\u2018Do you not see that unicorn?\u2019 Firenze bellowed at Bane. \u2018Do \nyou not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let \nyou in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this \nForest, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.\u2019 \n\nAnd Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best \nhe could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane \nbehind them. \n\nHarry didn\u2019t have a clue what was going on. \n\u2018Why\u2019s Bane so angry?\u2019 he asked. \u2018What was that thing you \n\nsaved me from, anyway?\u2019 \nFirenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head \n\nbowed in case of low-hanging branches but did not answer \nHarry\u2019s question. They made their way through the trees in silence \nfor so long that Harry thought Firenze didn\u2019t want to talk to him \nany more. They were passing through a particularly dense patch \nof trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped. \n\n\u2018Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?\u2019 \n\u2018No,\u2019 said Harry, startled by the odd question. \u2018We\u2019ve only used \n\nthe horn and tail-hair in Potions.\u2019 \n\u2018That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,\u2019 said \n\nFirenze. \u2018Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to \ngain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will \nkeep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a ter-\nrible price. You have slain something pure and defenceless to save \nyourself and you will have but a half life, a cursed life, from the \nmoment the blood touches your lips.\u2019 \n\nHarry stared at the back of Firenze\u2019s head, which was dappled \nsilver in the moonlight. \n\n\n\n THE  FORBIDDEN  FOREST 189 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018But who\u2019d be that desperate?\u2019 he wondered aloud. \u2018If you\u2019re \ngoing to be cursed for ever, death\u2019s better, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 \n\n\u2018It is,\u2019 Firenze agreed, \u2018unless all you need is to stay alive long \nenough to drink something else \u2013 something that will bring you \nback to full strength and power \u2013 something that will mean you \ncan never die. Mr Potter, do you know what is hidden in the \nschool at this very moment?\u2019 \n\n\u2018The Philosopher\u2019s Stone! Of course \u2013 the Elixir of Life! But I \ndon\u2019t understand who \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return \nto power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?\u2019 \n\nIt was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around \nHarry\u2019s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear \nonce more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: \n\u2018Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had \nenough human left in him to die.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Do you mean,\u2019 Harry croaked, \u2018that was Vol\u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Harry! Harry, are you all right?\u2019 \nHermione was running towards them down the path, Hagrid \n\npuffing along behind her. \n\u2018I\u2019m fine,\u2019 said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. \u2018The \n\nunicorn\u2019s dead, Hagrid, it\u2019s in that clearing back there.\u2019 \n\u2018This is where I leave you,\u2019 Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurried \n\noff to examine the unicorn. \u2018You are safe now.\u2019 \nHarry slid off his back. \n\u2018Good luck, Harry Potter,\u2019 said Firenze. \u2018The planets have been \n\nread wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of \nthose times.\u2019 \n\nHe turned and cantered back into the depths of the Forest, \nleaving Harry shivering behind him. \n\n* \nRon had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them \nto return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when \nHarry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though, \nhe was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what \nhad happened in the Forest. \n\nHarry couldn\u2019t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the \nfire. He was still shaking. \n\n\u2018Snape wants the stone for Voldemort ... and Voldemort\u2019s wait-\ning in the Forest ... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted \n\n\n\n190 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nto get rich ...\u2019 \n\u2018Stop saying the name!\u2019 said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he \n\nthought Voldemort could hear them. \nHarry wasn\u2019t listening. \n\u2018Firenze saved me, but he shouldn\u2019t have done ... Bane was furi-\n\nous ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say \nis going to happen ... They must show that Voldemort\u2019s coming \nback ... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me ... I \nsuppose that\u2019s written in the stars as well.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Will you stop saying the name!\u2019 Ron hissed. \n\u2018So all I\u2019ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,\u2019 Harry \n\nwent on feverishly, \u2018then Voldemort will be able to come and \nfinish me off ... Well, I suppose Bane\u2019ll be happy.\u2019 \n\nHermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of \ncomfort. \n\n\u2018Harry, everyone says Dumbledore\u2019s the only one You-Know-\nWho was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-\nWho won\u2019t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It \nsounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says \nthat\u2019s a very imprecise branch of magic.\u2019 \n\nThe sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They \nwent to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night\u2019s surprises \nweren\u2019t over. \n\nWhen Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility \nCloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned \nto it: \n\n \nJust in case. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER SIXTEEN \u2014 \n \n\nThrough the Trapdoor \n \n\nIn years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he had \nmanaged to get through his exams when he half expected \nVoldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet \nthe days crept by and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still \nalive and well behind the locked door. \n\nIt was swelteringly hot, especially in the large classroom where \nthey did their written papers. They had been given special, new \nquills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-\nCheating spell. \n\nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them \none by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-\ndance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a \nmouse into a snuff-box \u2013 points were given for how pretty the \nsnuff-box was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them \nall nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remem-\nber how to make a Forgetfulness Potion. \n\nHarry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains \nin his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip \ninto the Forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam \nnerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry \nkept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now \nworse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood \nin it. \n\nMaybe it was because they hadn\u2019t seen what Harry had seen in \nthe Forest, or because they didn\u2019t have scars burning on their fore-\nheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the \nStone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but he \ndidn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with \ntheir revision they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape \nor anyone else might be up to. \n\n\n\n192 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nTheir very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of answer-\ning questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented self-stirring \ncauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful week until \ntheir exam results came out. When the ghost of Professor Binns \ntold them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, \nHarry couldn\u2019t help cheering with the rest. \n\n\u2018That was far easier than I thought it would be,\u2019 said Hermione, \nas they joined the crowds flocking out into the sunny grounds. \u2018I \nneedn\u2019t have learnt about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or \nthe uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u2019 \n\nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers after-\nwards, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down \nto the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee \nJordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was bask-\ning in the warm shallows. \n\n\u2018No more revision,\u2019 Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the \ngrass. \u2018You could look more cheerful, Harry, we\u2019ve got a week before \nwe find out how badly we\u2019ve done, there\u2019s no need to worry yet.\u2019 \n\nHarry was rubbing his forehead. \n\u2018I wish I knew what this means!\u2019 he burst out angrily. \u2018My scar \n\nkeeps hurting \u2013 it\u2019s happened before, but never as often as this.\u2019 \n\u2018Go to Madam Pomfrey,\u2019 Hermione suggested. \n\u2018I\u2019m not ill,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I think it\u2019s a warning ... it means danger\u2019s \n\ncoming ...\u2019 \nRon couldn\u2019t get worked up, it was too hot. \n\u2018Harry, relax, Hermione\u2019s right, the Stone\u2019s safe as long as \n\nDumbledore\u2019s around. Anyway, we\u2019ve never had any proof Snape \nfound out how to get past Fluffy He nearly had his leg ripped off \nonce, he\u2019s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play \nQuidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.\u2019 \n\nHarry nodded, but he couldn\u2019t shake off a lurking feeling that \nthere was something he\u2019d forgotten to do, something important. \nWhen he tried to explain this, Hermione said, \u2018That\u2019s just the \nexams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my \nTransfiguration notes before I remembered we\u2019d done that one.\u2019 \n\nHarry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn\u2019t have anything \nto do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter towards the \nschool across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. \nHagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would \nnever betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 193 \n \n\n \n\nget past Fluffy ... never ... but \u2013 \nHarry suddenly jumped to his feet. \n\u2018Where\u2019re you going?\u2019 said Ron sleepily. \n\u2018I\u2019ve just thought of something,\u2019 said Harry. He had gone white. \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.\u2019 \n\u2018Why?\u2019 panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up. \n\u2018Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a bit odd,\u2019 said Harry, scrambling up the \n\ngrassy slope, \u2018that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a \ndragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in \nhis pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if \nit\u2019s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don\u2019t you think? \nWhy didn\u2019t I see it before?\u2019 \n\n\u2018What are you on about?\u2019 said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across \nthe grounds towards the Forest, didn\u2019t answer. \n\nHagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers \nand sleeves were rolled up and he was shelling peas into a large \nbowl. \n\n\u2018Hullo,\u2019 he said, smiling. \u2018Finished yer exams? Got time fer a \ndrink?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes, please,\u2019 said Ron, but Harry cut across him. \n\u2018No, we\u2019re in a hurry. Hagrid, I\u2019ve got to ask you something. You \n\nknow that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were \nplaying cards with look like?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Dunno,\u2019 said Hagrid casually, \u2018he wouldn\u2019 take his cloak off.\u2019 \nHe saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrows. \n\u2018It\u2019s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o\u2019 funny folk in the Hog\u2019s Head \n\n\u2013 that\u2019s one of the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a dragon \ndealer, mightn\u2019 he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.\u2019 \n\nHarry sank down next to the bowl of peas. \n\u2018What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention \n\nHogwarts at all?\u2019 \n\u2018Mighta come up,\u2019 said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remember. \n\n\u2018Yeah ... he asked what I did, an\u2019 I told him I was gamekeeper here \n... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after ... so I told \nhim ... an\u2019 I said what I\u2019d always really wanted was a dragon ... an\u2019 \nthen ... I can\u2019 remember too well, \u2019cause he kept buyin\u2019 me drinks ... \nLet\u2019s see ... yeah, then he said he had the dragon egg an\u2019 we could \nplay cards fer it if I wanted ... but he had ter be sure I could handle \nit, he didn\u2019 want it ter go ter any old home ... So I told him, after \nFluffy, a dragon would be easy ...\u2019 \n\n\n\n194 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018And did he \u2013 did he seem interested in Fluffy?\u2019 Harry asked, try-\ning to keep his voice calm. \n\n\u2018Well \u2013 yeah \u2013 how many three-headed dogs d\u2019yeh meet, even \naround Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy\u2019s a piece o\u2019 cake if yeh \nknow how to calm him down, jus\u2019 play him a bit o\u2019 music an\u2019 he\u2019ll \ngo straight off ter sleep \u2013\u2019 \n\nHagrid suddenly looked horrified. \n\u2018I shouldn\u2019ta told yeh that!\u2019 he blurted out. \u2018Forget I said it! Hey \n\n\u2013 where\u2019re yeh goin\u2019?\u2019 \nHarry, Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t speak to each other at all until \n\nthey came to a halt in the Entrance Hall, which seemed very cold \nand gloomy after the grounds. \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got to go to Dumbledore,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Hagrid told that \nstranger how to get past Fluffy and it was either Snape or \nVoldemort under that cloak \u2013 it must\u2019ve been easy once he\u2019d got \nHagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might \nback us up if Bane doesn\u2019t stop him. Where\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s office?\u2019 \n\nThey looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in \nthe right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore \nlived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him. \n\n\u2018We\u2019ll just have to \u2013\u2019 Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang \nacross the hall. \n\n\u2018What are you three doing inside?\u2019 \nIt was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books. \n\u2018We want to see Professor Dumbledore,\u2019 said Hermione, rather \n\nbravely, Harry and Ron thought. \n\u2018See Professor Dumbledore?\u2019 Professor McGonagall repeated, as \n\nthough this was a very fishy thing to want to do. \u2018Why?\u2019 \nHarry swallowed \u2013 now what? \n\u2018It\u2019s sort of secret,\u2019 he said, but he wished at once he hadn\u2019t, \n\nbecause Professor McGonagall\u2019s nostrils flared. \n\u2018Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,\u2019 she said coldly. \u2018He \n\nreceived an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for \nLondon at once.\u2019 \n\n\u2018He\u2019s gone?\u2019 said Harry frantically. \u2018Now?\u2019 \n\u2018Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has \n\nmany demands on his time \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018But this is important.\u2019 \n\u2018Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry \n\nof Magic, Potter?\u2019 \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 195 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Look,\u2019 said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, \u2018Professor \u2013 it\u2019s \nabout the Philosopher\u2019s Stone \u2013\u2019 \n\nWhatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn\u2019t that. \nThe books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms but she didn\u2019t \npick them up. \n\n\u2018How do you know \u2013?\u2019 she spluttered. \n\u2018Professor, I think \u2013 I know \u2013 that Sn\u2013 that someone\u2019s going to try \n\nand steal the Stone. I\u2019ve got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.\u2019 \nShe eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion. \n\u2018Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,\u2019 she said finally. \n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, \nno one can possibly steal it, it\u2019s too well protected.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But Professor \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Potter, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u2019 she said shortly. She bent \n\ndown and gathered up the fallen books. \u2018I suggest you all go back \noutside and enjoy the sunshine.\u2019 \n\nBut they didn\u2019t. \n\u2018It\u2019s tonight,\u2019 said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall \n\nwas out of earshot. \u2018Snape\u2019s going through the trapdoor tonight. \nHe\u2019s found out everything he needs and now he\u2019s got Dumbledore \nout of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry of Magic will \nget a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But what can we \u2013\u2019 \nHermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round. \nSnape was standing there. \n\u2018Good afternoon,\u2019 he said smoothly. \nThey stared at him. \n\u2018You shouldn\u2019t be inside on a day like this,\u2019 he said, with an odd, \n\ntwisted smile. \n\u2018We were \u2013\u2019 Harry began, without any idea what he was going to \n\nsay. \n\u2018You want to be more careful,\u2019 said Snape. \u2018Hanging around like \n\nthis, people will think you\u2019re up to something. And Gryffindor really \ncan\u2019t afford to lose any more points, can they?\u2019 \n\nHarry flushed. They turned to go back outside, but Snape called \nthem back. \n\n\u2018Be warned, Potter \u2013 any more night-time wanderings and I will \npersonally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.\u2019 \n\nHe strode off in the direction of the staff room. \nOut on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others. \n\n\n\n196 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Right, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do,\u2019 he whispered urgently. \u2018One \nof us has got to keep an eye on Snape \u2013 wait outside the staff room \nand follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you\u2019d better do that.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Why me?\u2019 \n\u2018It\u2019s obvious,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018You can pretend to be waiting for \n\nProfessor Flitwick, you know.\u2019 He put on a high voice, \u2018Oh Pro-\nfessor Flitwick, I\u2019m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b \nwrong ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, shut up,\u2019 said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch out \nfor Snape. \n\n\u2018And we\u2019d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,\u2019 Harry told \nRon. \u2018Come on.\u2019 \n\nBut that part of the plan didn\u2019t work. No sooner had they \nreached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than \nProfessor McGonagall turned up again, and this time, she lost her \ntemper. \n\n\u2018I suppose you think you\u2019re harder to get past than a pack of \nenchantments!\u2019 she stormed. \u2018Enough of this nonsense! If I hear \nyou\u2019ve come anywhere near here again, I\u2019ll take another fifty points \nfrom Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own house!\u2019 \n\nHarry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just \nsaid, \u2018At least Hermione\u2019s on Snape\u2019s tail,\u2019 when the portrait of the \nFat Lady swung open and Hermione came in. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Harry!\u2019 she wailed. \u2018Snape came out and asked me \nwhat I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape \nwent to get him, and I\u2019ve only just got away. I don\u2019t know where \nSnape went.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s it then, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Harry said. \nThe other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were \n\nglittering. \n\u2018I\u2019m going out of here tonight and I\u2019m going to try and get to the \n\nStone first.\u2019 \n\u2018You\u2019re mad!\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018You can\u2019t!\u2019 said Hermione. After what McGonagall and Snape \n\nhave said? You\u2019ll be expelled!\u2019 \n\u2018SO WHAT?\u2019 Harry shouted. \u2018Don\u2019t you understand? If Snape \n\ngets hold of the Stone, Voldemort\u2019s coming back! Haven\u2019t you heard \nwhat it was like when he was trying to take over? There won\u2019t be \nany Hogwarts to get expelled from! He\u2019ll flatten it, or turn it into a \nschool for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn\u2019t matter any more, \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 197 \n \n\n \n\ncan\u2019t you see? D\u2019you think he\u2019ll leave you and your families alone if \nGryffindor win the House Cup? If I get caught before I can get to \nthe Stone, well, I\u2019ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for \nVoldemort to find me there. It\u2019s only dying a bit later than I would \nhave done, because I\u2019m never going over to the Dark Side! I\u2019m \ngoing through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is \ngoing to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?\u2019 \n\nHe glared at them. \n\u2018You\u2019re right, Harry,\u2019 said Hermione in a small voice. \n\u2018I\u2019ll use the Invisibility Cloak,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018It\u2019s just lucky I got it \n\nback.\u2019 \n\u2018But will it cover all three of us?\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018All \u2013 all three of us?\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, come off it, you don\u2019t think we\u2019d let you go alone?\u2019 \n\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said Hermione briskly. \u2018How do you think you\u2019d \n\nget to the Stone without us? I\u2019d better go and look through my \nbooks, there might be something useful ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.\u2019 \n\u2018Not if I can help it,\u2019 said Hermione grimly. \u2018Flitwick told me in \n\nsecret that I got a hundred and twelve per cent on his exam. \nThey\u2019re not throwing me out after that.\u2019 \n\n* \nAfter dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common \nroom. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had any-\nthing to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he \nhadn\u2019t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her \nnotes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were \nabout to try and break. Harry and Ron didn\u2019t talk much. Both of \nthem were thinking about what they were about to do. \n\nSlowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed. \n\u2018Better get the Cloak,\u2019 Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left, \n\nstretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory. \nHe pulled out the Cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid \nhad given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on Fluffy \u2013 he \ndidn\u2019t feel much like singing. \n\nHe ran back down to the common room. \n\u2018We\u2019d better put the Cloak on here, and make sure it covers all \n\nthree of us \u2013 if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its \nown \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018What are you doing?\u2019 said a voice from the corner of the room. \n\n\n\n198 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nNeville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the \ntoad, who looked as though he\u2019d been making another bid for \nfreedom. \n\n\u2018Nothing, Neville, nothing,\u2019 said Harry, hurriedly putting the \nCloak behind his back. \n\nNeville stared at their guilty faces. \n\u2018You\u2019re going out again,\u2019 he said. \n\u2018No, no, no,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018No, we\u2019re not. Why don\u2019t you go \n\nto bed, Neville?\u2019 \nHarry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They couldn\u2019t \n\nafford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing \nFluffy to sleep. \n\n\u2018You can\u2019t go out,\u2019 said Neville, \u2018you\u2019ll be caught again. \nGryffindor will be in even more trouble.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You don\u2019t understand,\u2019 said Harry, \u2018this is important.\u2019 \nBut Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desper-\n\nate. \n\u2018I won\u2019t let you do it,\u2019 he said, hurrying to stand in front of the \n\nportrait hole. \u2018I\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll fight you!\u2019 \n\u2018Neville,\u2019 Ron exploded, \u2018get away from that hole and don\u2019t be an \n\nidiot \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Don\u2019t you call me an idiot!\u2019 said Neville. \u2018I don\u2019t think you \n\nshould be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told \nme to stand up to people!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yes, but not to us,\u2019 said Ron in exasperation. \u2018Neville, you don\u2019t \nknow what you\u2019re doing.\u2019 \n\nHe took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad, \nwho leapt out of sight. \n\n\u2018Go on then, try and hit me!\u2019 said Neville, raising his fists. \u2018I\u2019m \nready!\u2019 \n\nHarry turned to Hermione. \n\u2018Do something,\u2019 he said desperately. \nHermione stepped forward. \n\u2018Neville,\u2019 she said, \u2018I\u2019m really, really sorry about this.\u2019 \nShe raised her wand. \n\u2018Petrificus Totalus!\u2019 she cried, pointing it at Neville. \nNeville\u2019s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His \n\nwhole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on \nhis face, stiff as a board. \n\nHermione ran to turn him over. Neville\u2019s jaws were jammed \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 199 \n \n\n \n\ntogether so he couldn\u2019t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking \nat them in horror. \n\n\u2018What\u2019ve you done to him?\u2019 Harry whispered. \n\u2018It\u2019s the full Body-Bind,\u2019 said Hermione miserably. \u2018Oh, Neville, \n\nI\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 \n\u2018We had to, Neville, no time to explain,\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018You\u2019ll understand later, Neville,\u2019 said Ron, as they stepped over \n\nhim and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak. \nBut leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn\u2019t feel like a \n\nvery good omen. In their nervous state, every statue\u2019s shadow \nlooked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves \nswooping down on them. \n\nAt the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs Norris \nskulking near the top. \n\n\u2018Oh, let\u2019s kick her, just this once,\u2019 Ron whispered in Harry\u2019s ear, \nbut Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her, \nMrs Norris turned her lamp-like eyes on them, but didn\u2019t do \nanything. \n\nThey didn\u2019t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up \nto the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the \ncarpet so that people would trip. \n\n\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 he said suddenly as they climbed towards him. He \nnarrowed his wicked black eyes. \u2018Know you\u2019re there, even if I can\u2019t \nsee you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?\u2019 \n\nHe rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them. \n\u2018Should call Filch, I should, if something\u2019s a-creeping around \n\nunseen.\u2019 \nHarry had a sudden idea. \n\u2018Peeves,\u2019 he said, in a hoarse whisper, \u2018the Bloody Baron has his \n\nown reasons for being invisible.\u2019 \nPeeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in \n\ntime and hovered about a foot off the stairs. \n\u2018So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr Baron, sir,\u2019 he said greasily. \u2018My \n\nmistake, my mistake \u2013 I didn\u2019t see you \u2013 of course I didn\u2019t, you\u2019re \ninvisible \u2013 forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I have business here, Peeves,\u2019 croaked Harry. \u2018Stay away from \nthis place tonight.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I will, sir, I most certainly will,\u2019 said Peeves, rising up in the air \nagain. \u2018Hope your business goes well, Baron, I\u2019ll not bother you.\u2019 \n\nAnd he scooted off. \n\n\n\n200 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018Brilliant, Harry!\u2019 whispered Ron. \nA few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor \n\ncorridor \u2013 and the door was already ajar. \n\u2018Well, there you are,\u2019 Harry said quietly. \u2018Snape\u2019s already got past \n\nFluffy.\u2019 \nSeeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three \n\nof them what was facing them. Underneath the Cloak, Harry \nturned to the other two. \n\n\u2018If you want to go back, I won\u2019t blame you,\u2019 he said. \u2018You can take \nthe Cloak, I won\u2019t need it now.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018We\u2019re coming,\u2019 said Hermione. \nHarry pushed the door open. \nAs the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All \n\nthree of the dog\u2019s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even \nthough it couldn\u2019t see them. \n\n\u2018What\u2019s that at its feet?\u2019 Hermione whispered. \n\u2018Looks like a harp,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Snape must have left it there.\u2019 \n\u2018It must wake up the moment you stop playing,\u2019 said Harry. \n\n\u2018Well, here goes ...\u2019 \nHe put Hagrid\u2019s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn\u2019t really a tune, \n\nbut from the first note the beast\u2019s eyes began to droop. Harry hardly \ndrew breath. Slowly, the dog\u2019s growls ceased \u2013 it tottered on its \npaws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast \nasleep. \n\n\u2018Keep playing,\u2019 Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the \nCloak and crept towards the trapdoor. They could feel the dog\u2019s \nhot, smelly breath as they approached the giant heads. \n\n\u2018I think we\u2019ll be able to pull the door open,\u2019 said Ron, peering \nover the dog\u2019s back. \u2018Want to go first, Hermione?\u2019 \n\n\u2018No, I don\u2019t!\u2019 \n\u2018All right.\u2019 Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the \n\ndog\u2019s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which \nswung up and open. \n\n\u2018What can you see?\u2019 Hermione said anxiously. \n\u2018Nothing \u2013 just black \u2013 there\u2019s no way of climbing down, we\u2019ll \n\njust have to drop.\u2019 \nHarry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his \n\nattention and pointed at himself. \n\u2018You want to go first? Are you sure?\u2019 said Ron. \u2018I don\u2019t know how \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 201 \n \n\n \n\ndeep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep \nhim asleep.\u2019 \n\nHarry handed the flute over. In the few seconds\u2019 silence, the dog \ngrowled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it \nfell back into its deep sleep. \n\nHarry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor. \nThere was no sign of the bottom. \n\nHe lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on \nby his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, \u2018If anything \nhappens to me, don\u2019t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send \nHedwig to Dumbledore, right?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Right,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018See you in a minute, I hope ...\u2019 \nAnd Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell \n\ndown, down, down and \u2013 \nFLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on some-\n\nthing soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the \ngloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s OK!\u2019 he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp \nwhich was the open trapdoor. \u2018It\u2019s a soft landing, you can jump!\u2019 \n\nRon followed straight away. He landed sprawled next to Harry. \n\u2018What\u2019s this stuff?\u2019 were his first words. \n\u2018Dunno, sort of plant thing. I suppose it\u2019s here to break the fall. \n\nCome on, Hermione!\u2019 \nThe distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog, \n\nbut Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry\u2019s other \nside. \n\n\u2018We must be miles under the school,\u2019 she said. \n\u2018Lucky this plant thing\u2019s here, really,\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Lucky!\u2019 shrieked Hermione. \u2018Look at you both!\u2019 \nShe leapt up and struggled towards a damp wall. She had to \n\nstruggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started \nto twist snake-like tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and \nRon, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers \nwithout their noticing. \n\nHermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm \ngrip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to \npull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the \ntighter and faster the plant wound around them. \n\n\u2018Stop moving!\u2019 Hermione ordered them. \u2018I know what this is \u2013 it\u2019s \n\n\n\n202 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nDevil\u2019s Snare!\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, I\u2019m so glad we know what it\u2019s called, that\u2019s a great help,\u2019 \n\nsnarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant curling around \nhis neck. \n\n\u2018Shut up, I\u2019m trying to remember how to kill it!\u2019 said Hermione. \n\u2018Well, hurry up, I can\u2019t breathe!\u2019 Harry gasped, wrestling with it \n\nas it curled around his chest. \n\u2018Devil\u2019s Snare, Devil\u2019s Snare ... What did Professor Sprout say? It \n\nlikes the dark and the damp \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018So light a fire!\u2019 Harry choked. \n\u2018Yes \u2013 of course \u2013 but there\u2019s no wood!\u2019 Hermione cried, wringing \n\nher hands. \n\u2018HAVE YOU GONE MAD?\u2019 Ron bellowed. \u2018ARE YOU A WITCH \n\nOR NOT?\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, right!\u2019 said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, \n\nwaved it, muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell \nflames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds, \nthe two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the \nlight and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unravelled itself from \ntheir bodies and they were able to pull free. \n\n\u2018Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u2019 said Harry as \nhe joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018and lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a crisis \n\u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s no wood\u201d, honestly.\u2019 \n\n\u2018This way,\u2019 said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway which \nwas the only way on. \n\nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip \nof water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped down-\nwards and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant \njolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding \nvaults in the wizards\u2019 bank. If they met a dragon, a fully grown \ndragon \u2013 Norbert had been bad enough ... \n\n\u2018Can you hear something?\u2019 Ron whispered. \nHarry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming \n\nfrom up ahead. \n\u2018Do you think it\u2019s a ghost?\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t know ... sounds like wings to me.\u2019 \n\u2018There\u2019s light ahead \u2013 I can see something moving.\u2019 \nThey reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a \n\nbrilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 203 \n \n\n \n\nfull of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around \nthe room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy, \nwooden door. \n\n\u2018Do you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018Probably,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018They don\u2019t look very vicious, but I sup-\n\npose if they all swooped down at once ... Well, there\u2019s nothing for it \n... I\u2019ll run.\u2019 \n\nHe took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms and sprinted \nacross the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing \nat him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the door \nuntouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \n\nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the \ndoor, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, not even when Hermione tried her \nAlohomora Charm. \n\n\u2018Now what?\u2019 said Ron. \n\u2018These birds ... they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u2019 said \n\nHermione. \nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \u2013 glittering? \n\u2018They\u2019re not birds!\u2019 Harry said suddenly, \u2018they\u2019re keys! Winged \n\nkeys \u2013 look carefully. So that must mean ...\u2019 he looked around the \nchamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys. \n\u2018... Yes \u2013 look! Broomsticks! We\u2019ve got to catch the key to the door!\u2019 \n\n\u2018But there are hundreds of them!\u2019 \nRon examined the lock on the door. \n\u2018We\u2019re looking for a big, old-fashioned one \u2013 probably silver, \n\nlike the handle.\u2019 \nThey seized a broomstick each and kicked off into the air, soar-\n\ning into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched \nbut the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost \nimpossible to catch one. \n\nNot for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a \ncentury. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn\u2019t. \nAfter a minute\u2019s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feath-\ners, he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had \nalready been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole. \n\n\u2018That one!\u2019 he called to the others. \u2018That big one \u2013 there \u2013 no, \nthere \u2013 with bright blue wings \u2013 the feathers are all crumpled on \none side.\u2019 \n\nRon went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing, \ncrashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom. \n\n\n\n204 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\n\u2018We\u2019ve got to close in on it!\u2019 Harry called, not taking his eyes off \nthe key with the damaged wing. \u2018Ron, you come at it from above \u2013\nHermione, stay below and stop it going down \u2013 and I\u2019ll try and \ncatch it. Right, NOW!\u2019 \n\nRon dived, Hermione rocketed upwards, the key dodged them \nboth and Harry streaked after it; it sped towards the wall, Harry \nleant forward and with a nasty crunching noise, pinned it against \nthe stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed \naround the high chamber. \n\nThey landed quickly and Harry ran to the door, the key strug-\ngling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned \u2013 it \nworked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took flight \nagain, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \n\n\u2018Ready?\u2019 Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door \nhandle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \n\nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. \nBut as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to \nreveal an astonishing sight. \n\nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind \nthe black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and \ncarved from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across \nthe chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shiv-\nered slightly \u2013 the towering white chessmen had no faces. \n\n\u2018Now what do we do?\u2019 Harry whispered. \n\u2018It\u2019s obvious, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Ron. \u2018We\u2019ve got to play our way across \n\nthe room.\u2019 \nBehind the white pieces they could see another door. \n\u2018How?\u2019 said Hermione nervously. \n\u2018I think,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018we\u2019re going to have to be chessmen.\u2019 \nHe walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch \n\nthe knight\u2019s horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse \npawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to \nlook down at Ron. \n\n\u2018Do we \u2013 er \u2013 have to join you to get across?\u2019 \nThe black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two. \n\u2018This wants thinking about ...\u2019 he said. \u2018I suppose we\u2019ve got to \n\ntake the place of three of the black pieces ...\u2019 \nHarry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally \n\nhe said, \u2018Now, don\u2019t be offended or anything, but neither of you are \nthat good at chess \u2013\u2019 \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 205 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018We\u2019re not offended,\u2019 said Harry quickly. \u2018Just tell us what to do.\u2019 \n\u2018Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione, \n\nyou go there instead of that castle.\u2019 \n\u2018What about you?\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m going to be a knight,\u2019 said Ron. \nThe chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these \n\nwords a knight, a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the \nwhite pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares \nwhich Harry, Ron and Hermione took. \n\n\u2018White always plays first in chess,\u2019 said Ron, peering across the \nboard. \u2018Yes ... look ...\u2019 \n\nA white pawn had moved forward two squares. \nRon started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently wher-\n\never he sent them. Harry\u2019s knees were trembling. What if they lost? \n\u2018Harry \u2013 move diagonally four squares to the right.\u2019 \nTheir first real shock came when their other knight was taken. \n\nThe white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the \nboard, where he lay quite still, face down. \n\n\u2018Had to let that happen,\u2019 said Ron, looking shaken. \u2018Leaves you \nfree to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.\u2019 \n\nEvery time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed \nno mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped \nalong the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry and \nHermione were in danger. He himself darted around the board \ntaking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones. \n\n\u2018We\u2019re nearly there,\u2019 he muttered suddenly. \u2018Let me think \u2013 let me \nthink ...\u2019 \n\nThe white queen turned her blank face towards him. \n\u2018Yes ...\u2019 said Ron softly, \u2018it\u2019s the only way ... I\u2019ve got to be taken.\u2019 \n\u2018NO!\u2019 Harry and Hermione shouted. \n\u2018That\u2019s chess!\u2019 snapped Ron. \u2018You\u2019ve got to make some sacrifices! \n\nI\u2019ll make my move and she\u2019ll take me \u2013 that leaves you free to \ncheckmate the king, Harry!\u2019 \n\n\u2018But \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Do you want to stop Snape or not?\u2019 \n\u2018Ron \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Look, if you don\u2019t hurry up, he\u2019ll already have the Stone!\u2019 \nThere was nothing else for it. \n\u2018Ready?\u2019 Ron called, his face pale but determined. \u2018Here I go \u2013 \n\nnow, don\u2019t hang around once you\u2019ve won.\u2019 \n\n\n\n206 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHe stepped forward and the white queen pounced. She struck \nRon hard around the head with her stone arm and he crashed to \nthe floor \u2013 Hermione screamed but stayed on her square \u2013 the \nwhite queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he\u2019d been \nknocked out. \n\nShaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left. \nThe white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry\u2019s feet. \n\nThey had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door \nahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and \nHermione charged through the door and up the next passageway. \n\n\u2018What if he\u2019s \u2013?\u2019 \n\u2018He\u2019ll be all right,\u2019 said Harry, trying to convince himself. \u2018What \n\ndo you reckon\u2019s next?\u2019 \n\u2018We\u2019ve had Sprout\u2019s, that was the Devil\u2019s Snare \u2013 Flitwick must\u2019ve \n\nput charms on the keys \u2013 McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to \nmake them alive \u2013 that leaves Quirrell\u2019s spell, and Snape\u2019s ...\u2019 \n\nThey had reached another door. \n\u2018All right?\u2019 Harry whispered. \n\u2018Go on.\u2019 \nHarry pushed it open. \nA disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull \n\ntheir robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the \nfloor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had \ntackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head. \n\n\u2018I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to fight that one,\u2019 Harry whispered, as \nthey stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. \u2018Come on, I can\u2019t \nbreathe.\u2019 \n\nHe pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to \nlook at what came next \u2013 but there was nothing very frightening in \nhere, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on \nit in a line. \n\n\u2018Snape\u2019s,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018What do we have to do?\u2019 \nThey stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang \n\nup behind them in the doorway. It wasn\u2019t ordinary fire either; it was \npurple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway \nleading onwards. They were trapped. \n\n\u2018Look!\u2019 Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. \nHarry looked over her shoulder to read it: \n\n \nDanger lies before you, while safety lies behind, \n\n\n\n THROUGH  THE  TRAPDOOR 207 \n \n\n \n\nTwo of us will help you, whichever you would find, \nOne among us seven will let you move ahead, \nAnother will transport the drinker back instead, \nTwo among our number hold only nettle wine, \nThree of us are killers, waiting hidden in line. \nChoose, unless you wish to stay here for evermore, \nTo help you in your choice, we give you these clues four: \nFirst, however slyly the poison tries to hide \nYou will always find some on nettle wine\u2019s left side; \nSecond, different are those who stand at either end, \nBut if you would move onwards, neither is your friend; \nThird, as you see clearly, all are different size, \nNeither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides; \nFourth, the second left and the second on the right \nAre twins once you taste them, though different at first sight. \n \n\nHermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was \nsmiling, the very last thing he felt like doing. \n\n\u2018Brilliant,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018This isn\u2019t magic \u2013 it\u2019s logic \u2013 a puzzle. \nA lot of the greatest wizards haven\u2019t got an ounce of logic, they\u2019d be \nstuck in here for ever.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But so will we, won\u2019t we?\u2019 \n\u2018Of course not,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018Everything we need is here on \n\nthis paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will \nget us safely through the black fire and one will get us back \nthrough the purple.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But how do we know which to drink?\u2019 \n\u2018Give me a minute.\u2019 \nHermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up \n\nand down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at \nthem. At last, she clapped her hands. \n\n\u2018Got it,\u2019 she said. \u2018The smallest bottle will get us through the \nblack fire \u2013 towards the Stone.\u2019 \n\nHarry looked at the tiny bottle. \n\u2018There\u2019s only enough there for one of us,\u2019 he said. \u2018That\u2019s hardly \n\none swallow.\u2019 \nThey looked at each other. \n\u2018Which one will get you back through the purple flames?\u2019 \nHermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line. \n\u2018You drink that,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018No, listen \u2013 get back and get Ron \u2013 \n\n\n\n208 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ngrab brooms from the flying-key room, they\u2019ll get you out of the \ntrapdoor and past Fluffy \u2013 go straight to the owlery and send \nHedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold \nSnape off for a while, but I\u2019m no match for him really.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But Harry \u2013 what if You-Know-Who\u2019s with him?\u2019 \n\u2018Well \u2013 I was lucky once, wasn\u2019t I?\u2019 said Harry, pointing at his \n\nscar. \u2018I might get lucky again.\u2019 \nHermione\u2019s lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at Harry and \n\nthrew her arms around him. \n\u2018Hermione!\u2019 \n\u2018Harry \u2013 you\u2019re a great wizard, you know.\u2019 \n\u2018I\u2019m not as good as you,\u2019 said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let \n\ngo of him. \n\u2018Me!\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018Books! And cleverness! There are more \n\nimportant things \u2013 friendship and bravery and \u2013 oh Harry \u2013 be \ncareful!\u2019 \n\n\u2018You drink first,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018You are sure which is which, aren\u2019t \nyou?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Positive,\u2019 said Hermione. She took a long drink from the round \nbottle at the end and shuddered. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s not poison?\u2019 said Harry anxiously. \n\u2018No \u2013 but it\u2019s like ice.\u2019 \n\u2018Quick, go, before it wears off.\u2019 \n\u2018Good luck \u2013 take care \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018GO!\u2019 \nHermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire. \nHarry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He \n\nturned to face the black flames. \n\u2018Here I come,\u2019 he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp. \nIt was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the \n\nbottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black \nflames licking his body but couldn\u2019t feel them \u2013 for a moment he \ncould see nothing but dark fire \u2013 then he was on the other side, in \nthe last chamber. \n\nThere was already someone there \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t Snape. It wasn\u2019t \neven Voldemort. \n \n\n\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\u2014 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN \u2014 \n \n\nThe Man with Two Faces \n \n\nIt was Quirrell. \n\u2018You!\u2019 gasped Harry. \nQuirrell smiled. His face wasn\u2019t twitching at all. \n\u2018Me,\u2019 he said calmly, \u2018I wondered whether I\u2019d be meeting you \n\nhere, Potter.\u2019 \n\u2018But I thought \u2013 Snape \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Severus?\u2019 Quirrell laughed and it wasn\u2019t his usual quivering \n\ntreble, either, but cold and sharp. \u2018Yes, Severus does seem the \ntype, doesn\u2019t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an \novergrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor st-\nstuttering P-Professor Quirrell?\u2019 \n\nHarry couldn\u2019t take it in. This couldn\u2019t be true, it couldn\u2019t. \n\u2018But Snape tried to kill me!\u2019 \n\u2018No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger acci-\n\ndentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that \nQuidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another \nfew seconds and I\u2019d have got you off that broom. I\u2019d have man-\naged it before then if Snape hadn\u2019t been muttering a counter-\ncurse, trying to save you.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Snape was trying to save me?\u2019 \n\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Quirrell coolly. \u2018Why do you think he wanted \n\nto referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn\u2019t do \nit again. Funny, really ... he needn\u2019t have bothered. I couldn\u2019t do \nanything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers \nthought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor winning, he did \nmake himself unpopular ... and what a waste of time, when after \nall that, I\u2019m going to kill you tonight.\u2019 \n\nQuirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and \nwrapped themselves tightly around Harry. \n\n\u2018You\u2019re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school at \n\n\n\n210 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHallowe\u2019en like that, for all I knew you\u2019d seen me coming to look \nat what was guarding the Stone.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You let the troll in?\u2019 \n\u2018Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls \u2013 you must have seen \n\nwhat I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately, \nwhile everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape, \nwho already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to \nhead me off \u2013 and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, \nthat three-headed dog didn\u2019t even manage to bite Snape\u2019s leg off \nproperly. \n\n\u2018Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting \nmirror.\u2019 \n\nIt was only then that Harry realised what was standing behind \nQuirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised. \n\n\u2018This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,\u2019 Quirrell mur-\nmured, tapping his way around the frame. \u2018Trust Dumbledore to \ncome up with something like this ... but he\u2019s in London ... I\u2019ll be \nfar away by the time he gets back ...\u2019 \n\nAll Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and \nstop him concentrating on the Mirror. \n\n\u2018I saw you and Snape in the Forest \u2013\u2019 he blurted out. \n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Quirrell idly, walking around the Mirror to look at \n\nthe back. \u2018He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far \nI\u2019d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me \u2013 as \nthough he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side ...\u2019 \n\nQuirrell came back out from behind the Mirror and stared hun-\ngrily into it. \n\n\u2018I see the Stone ... I\u2019m presenting it to my master ... but where is \nit?\u2019 \n\nHarry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn\u2019t \ngive. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to \nthe Mirror. \n\n\u2018But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, he does,\u2019 said Quirrell casually, \u2018heavens, yes. He was at \n\nHogwarts with your father, didn\u2019t you know? They loathed each \nother. But he never wanted you dead.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing \u2013 I thought Snape was \nthreatening you ...\u2019 \n\nFor the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell\u2019s face. \n\u2018Sometimes,\u2019 he said, \u2018I find it hard to follow my master\u2019s \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 211 \n \n\n \n\ninstructions \u2013 he is a great wizard and I am weak \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018You mean he was there in the classroom with you?\u2019 Harry \n\ngasped. \n\u2018He is with me wherever I go,\u2019 said Quirrell quietly. \u2018I met him \n\nwhen I travelled around the world. A foolish young man I was \nthen, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort \nshowed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is \nonly power, and those too weak to seek it ... Since then, I have \nserved him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. \nHe has had to be very hard on me.\u2019 Quirrell shivered suddenly. \u2018He \ndoes not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to steal the Stone \nfrom Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me ... decided \nhe would have to keep a closer watch on me ...\u2019 \n\nQuirrell\u2019s voice tailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to \nDiagon Alley \u2013 how could he have been so stupid? He\u2019d seen \nQuirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky \nCauldron. \n\nQuirrell cursed under his breath. \n\u2018I don\u2019t understand ... is the Stone inside the Mirror? Should I \n\nbreak it?\u2019 \nHarry\u2019s mind was racing. \nWhat I want more than anything else in the world at the \n\nmoment, he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So \nif I look in the Mirror, I should see myself finding it \u2013 which \nmeans I\u2019ll see where it\u2019s hidden! But how can I look without \nQuirrell realising what I\u2019m up to? \n\nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without \nQuirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight: \nhe tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking \nto himself. \n\n\u2018What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, \nMaster!\u2019 \n\nAnd to Harry\u2019s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed \nto come from Quirrell himself. \n\n\u2018Use the boy ... Use the boy ...\u2019 \nQuirrell rounded on Harry. \n\u2018Yes \u2013 Potter \u2013 come here.\u2019 \nHe clapped his hands once and the ropes binding Harry fell off. \n\nHarry got slowly to his feet. \n\u2018Come here,\u2019 Quirrell repeated. \u2018Look in the Mirror and tell me \n\n\n\n212 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nwhat you see.\u2019 \nHarry walked towards him. \n\u2018I must lie,\u2019 he thought desperately. \u2018I must look and lie about \n\nwhat I see, that\u2019s all.\u2019 \nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny \n\nsmell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his \neyes, stepped in front of the Mirror and opened them again. \n\nHe saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a \nmoment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its \npocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the \nStone back in its pocket \u2013 and as it did so, Harry felt something \nheavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow \u2013 incredibly \u2013 he\u2019d got \nthe Stone. \n\n\u2018Well?\u2019 said Quirrell impatiently. \u2018What do you see?\u2019 \nHarry screwed up his courage. \n\u2018I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,\u2019 he invented. \u2018I \u2013 \n\nI\u2019ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\u2019 \nQuirrell cursed again. \n\u2018Get out of the way,\u2019 he said. As Harry moved aside he felt the \n\nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it? \nBut he hadn\u2019t walked five paces before a high voice spoke, \n\nthough Quirrell wasn\u2019t moving his lips. \n\u2018He lies ... He lies ...\u2019 \n\u2018Potter, come back here!\u2019 Quirrell shouted. \u2018Tell me the truth! \n\nWhat did you just see?\u2019 \nThe high voice spoke again. \n\u2018Let me speak to him ... face to face ...\u2019 \n\u2018Master, you are not strong enough!\u2019 \n\u2018I have strength enough ... for this ...\u2019 \nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He \n\ncouldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached \nup and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The tur-\nban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. \nThen he turned slowly on the spot. \n\nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. \nWhere there should have been a back to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was \na face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk \nwhite with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \n\n\u2018Harry Potter ...\u2019 it whispered. \nHarry tried to take a step backwards but his legs wouldn\u2019t move. \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 213 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018See what I have become?\u2019 the face said. \u2018Mere shadow and \nvapour ... I have form only when I can share another\u2019s body ... but \nthere have always been those willing to let me into their hearts \nand minds ... Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past \nweeks ... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the Forest \n... and once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body \nof my own ... Now ... why don\u2019t you give me that Stone in your \npocket?\u2019 \n\nSo he knew The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry\u2019s legs. \nHe stumbled backwards. \n\n\u2018Don\u2019t be a fool,\u2019 snarled the face. \u2018Better save your own life and \njoin me ... or you\u2019ll meet the same end as your parents ... They \ndied begging me for mercy ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018LIAR!\u2019 Harry shouted suddenly. \nQuirrell was walking backwards at him, so that Voldemort \n\ncould still see him. The evil face was now smiling. \n\u2018How touching ...\u2019 it hissed. \u2018I always value bravery ... Yes, boy, \n\nyour parents were brave ... I killed your father first and he put up \na courageous fight ... but your mother needn\u2019t have died ... she \nwas trying to protect you ... Now give me the Stone, unless you \nwant her to have died in vain.\u2019 \n\n\u2018NEVER!\u2019 \nHarry sprang towards the flame door, but Voldemort screamed, \n\n\u2018SEIZE HIM!\u2019 and, next second, Harry felt Quirrell\u2019s hand close on \nhis wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across Harry\u2019s scar; \nhis head felt as though it was about to split in two; he yelled, \nstruggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let go of \nhim. The pain in his head lessened \u2013 he looked around wildly to \nsee where Quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain, look-\ning at his fingers \u2013 they were blistering before his eyes. \n\n\u2018Seize him! SEIZE HIM!\u2019 shrieked Voldemort again and Quirrell \nlunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of him, \nboth hands around Harry\u2019s neck \u2013 Harry\u2019s scar was almost blind-\ning him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony. \n\n\u2018Master, I cannot hold him \u2013 my hands \u2013 my hands!\u2019 \nAnd Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his \n\nknees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms \n\u2013 Harry could see they looked burnt, raw, red and shiny. \n\n\u2018Then kill him, fool, and be done!\u2019 screeched Voldemort. \nQuirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, \n\n\n\n214 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nby instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell\u2019s face \u2013 \n\u2018AAAARGH!\u2019 \nQuirrell rolled off him, his face blistering too, and then Harry \n\nknew: Quirrell couldn\u2019t touch his bare skin, not without suffering \nterrible pain \u2013 his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep \nhim in enough pain to stop him doing a curse. \n\nHarry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm and hung \non as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw \nHarry off \u2013 the pain in Harry\u2019s head was building \u2013 he couldn\u2019t see \n\u2013 he could only hear Quirrell\u2019s terrible shrieks and Voldemort\u2019s \nyells of \u2018KILL HIM! KILL HIM!\u2019 and other voices, maybe in \nHarry\u2019s own head, crying, \u2018Harry! Harry!\u2019 \n\nHe felt Quirrell\u2019s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was \nlost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... down ... \n\n* \nSomething gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried \nto catch it, but his arms were too heavy. \n\nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. \nHow strange. \n\nHe blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam \ninto view above him. \n\n\u2018Good afternoon, Harry,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \nHarry stared at him. Then he remembered. \u2018Sir! The Stone! It \n\nwas Quirrell! He\u2019s got the Stone! Sir, quick \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,\u2019 said \n\nDumbledore. \u2018Quirrell does not have the Stone.\u2019 \n\u2018Then who does? Sir, I \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown \n\nout.\u2019 \nHarry swallowed and looked around him. He realised he must \n\nbe in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen \nsheets and next to him was a table piled high with what looked \nlike half the sweet-shop. \n\n\u2018Tokens from your friends and admirers,\u2019 said Dumbledore, \nbeaming. \u2018What happened down in the dungeons between you and \nProfessor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole \nschool knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George \nWeasley were responsible for trying to send you a lavatory seat. No \ndoubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, \nhowever, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 215 \n \n\n \n\n\u2018How long have I been in here?\u2019 \n\u2018Three days. Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most \n\nrelieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.\u2019 \n\u2018But sir, the Stone \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. \n\nProfessor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in \ntime to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your \nown, I must say.\u2019 \n\n\u2018You got there? You got Hermione\u2019s owl?\u2019 \n\u2018We must have crossed in mid-air. No sooner had I reached \n\nLondon than it became clear to me that the place I should be was \nthe one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off \nyou \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018It was you.\u2019 \n\u2018I feared I might be too late.\u2019 \n\u2018You nearly were, I couldn\u2019t have kept him off the Stone much \n\nlonger \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Not the Stone, boy, you \u2013 the effort involved nearly killed you. \n\nFor one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the \nStone, it has been destroyed.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Destroyed?\u2019 said Harry blankly. \u2018But your friend \u2013 Nicolas \nFlamel \u2013\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh, you know about Nicolas?\u2019 said Dumbledore, sounding \nquite delighted. \u2018You did do the thing properly, didn\u2019t you? Well, \nNicolas and I have had a little chat and agreed it\u2019s all for the best.\u2019 \n\n\u2018But that means he and his wife will die, won\u2019t they?\u2019 \n\u2018They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and \n\nthen, yes, they will die.\u2019 \nDumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry\u2019s face. \n\u2018To one as young as you, I\u2019m sure it seems incredible, but to \n\nNicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, \nvery long day. After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but \nthe next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such \na wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! \nThe two things most human beings would choose above all \u2013 the \ntrouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those \nthings which are worst for them.\u2019 \n\nHarry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little \nand smiled at the ceiling. \n\n\u2018Sir?\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking ... Sir \u2013 even if the Stone\u2019s \n\n\n\n216 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ngone, Vol\u2013 ... I mean, You-Know-Who \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for \n\nthings. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.\u2019 \n\u2018Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort\u2019s going to try other ways of coming \n\nback, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he hasn\u2019t gone, has he?\u2019 \n\u2018No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps \n\nlooking for another body to share ... not being truly alive, he can-\nnot be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy \nto his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you \nmay only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take \nsomeone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle \nnext time \u2013 and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may \nnever return to power.\u2019 \n\nHarry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head \nhurt. Then he said, \u2018Sir, there are some other things I\u2019d like \nto know, if you can tell me ... things I want to know the truth \nabout ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018The truth.\u2019 Dumbledore sighed. \u2018It is a beautiful and terrible \nthing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. \nHowever, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good \nreason not to, in which case I beg you\u2019ll forgive me. I shall not, of \ncourse, lie.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because \nshe tried to stop him killing me. But why would he want to kill \nme in the first place?\u2019 \n\nDumbledore sighed very deeply this time. \n\u2018Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. \n\nNot now. You will know, one day ... put it from your mind for \nnow, Harry. When you are older ... I know you hate to hear this ... \nwhen you are ready, you will know.\u2019 \n\nAnd Harry knew it would be no good to argue. \n\u2018But why couldn\u2019t Quirrell touch me?\u2019 \n\u2018Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort \n\ncannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realise that love as power-\nful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no \nvisible sign ... to have been loved so deeply, even though the person \nwho loved us is gone, will give us some protection for ever. It is in \nyour very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed and ambition, sharing \nhis soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this reason. It \nwas agony to touch a person marked by something so good.\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 217 \n \n\n \n\nDumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the \nwindowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet. \nWhen he had found his voice again, Harry said, \u2018And the \nInvisibility Cloak \u2013 do you know who sent it to me?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Ah \u2013 your father happened to leave it in my possession and I \nthought you might like it.\u2019 Dumbledore\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u2018Useful \nthings ... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the \nkitchens to steal food when he was here.\u2019 \n\n\u2018And there\u2019s something else ...\u2019 \n\u2018Fire away.\u2019 \n\u2018Quirrell said Snape \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Professor Snape, Harry.\u2019 \n\u2018Yes, him \u2013 Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my \n\nfather. Is that true?\u2019 \n\u2018Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and \n\nMr Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could \nnever forgive.\u2019 \n\n\u2018What?\u2019 \n\u2018He saved his life.\u2019 \n\u2018What?\u2019 \n\u2018Yes ...\u2019 said Dumbledore dreamily. \u2018Funny, the way people\u2019s \n\nminds work, isn\u2019t it? Professor Snape couldn\u2019t bear being in your \nfather\u2019s debt ... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this \nyear because he felt that would make him and your father quits. \nThen he could go back to hating your father\u2019s memory in peace ...\u2019 \n\nHarry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so \nhe stopped. \n\n\u2018And sir, there\u2019s one more thing ...\u2019 \n\u2018Just the one?\u2019 \n\u2018How did I get the Stone out of the Mirror?\u2019 \n\u2018Ah, now, I\u2019m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more \n\nbrilliant ideas, and between you and me, that\u2019s saying something. \nYou see, only one who wanted to find the Stone \u2013 find it, but not \nuse it \u2013 would be able to get it, otherwise they\u2019d just see them-\nselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life. My brain surprises \neven me sometimes ... Now, enough questions. I suggest you make \na start on these sweets. Ah! Bertie Bott\u2019s Every-Flavour Beans! I \nwas unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomit-\nflavoured one, and since then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve rather lost my liking \nfor them \u2013 but I think I\u2019ll be safe with a nice toffee, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \n\n\n\n218 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nHe smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth. \nThen he choked and said, \u2018Alas! Earwax!\u2019 \n\n* \nMadam Pomfrey, the matron, was a nice woman, but very strict. \n\n\u2018Just five minutes,\u2019 Harry pleaded. \n\u2018Absolutely not.\u2019 \n\u2018You let Professor Dumbledore in ...\u2019 \n\u2018Well, of course, that was the Headmaster, quite different. You \n\nneed rest.\u2019 \n\u2018I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, \n\nMadam Pomfrey ...\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, very well,\u2019 she said. \u2018But five minutes only.\u2019 \nAnd she let Ron and Hermione in. \n\u2018Harry!\u2019 \nHermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but \n\nHarry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore. \n\u2018Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to \u2013 Dumbledore was \n\nso worried \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018The whole school\u2019s talking about it,\u2019 said Ron. \u2018What really \n\nhappened?\u2019 \nIt was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even \n\nmore strange and exciting than the wild rumours. Harry told \nthem everything: Quirrell; the Mirror; the Stone and Voldemort. \nRon and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all \nthe right places and, when Harry told them what was under \nQuirrell\u2019s turban, Hermione screamed out loud. \n\n\u2018So the Stone\u2019s gone?\u2019 said Ron finally. \u2018Flamel\u2019s just going to \ndie?\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that \u2013 what was \nit? \u2013 \u201cto the well-organised mind, death is but the next great \nadventure\u201d.\u2019 \n\n\u2018I always said he was off his rocker,\u2019 said Ron, looking quite \nimpressed at how mad his hero was. \n\n\u2018So what happened to you two?\u2019 said Harry. \n\u2018Well, I got back all right,\u2019 said Hermione. \u2018I brought Ron round \n\n\u2013 that took a while \u2013 and we were dashing up to the owlery to \ncontact Dumbledore when we met him in the Entrance Hall. He \nalready knew \u2013 he just said, \u201cHarry\u2019s gone after him, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d \nand hurtled off to the third floor.\u2019 \n\n\u2018D\u2019you think he meant you to do it?\u2019 said Ron. \u2018Sending you \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 219 \n \n\n \n\nyour father\u2019s Cloak and everything?\u2019 \n\u2018Well,\u2019 Hermione exploded, \u2018if he did \u2013 I mean to say \u2013 that\u2019s \n\nterrible \u2013 you could have been killed.\u2019 \n\u2018No, it isn\u2019t,\u2019 said Harry thoughtfully. \u2018He\u2019s a funny man, \n\nDumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I \nthink he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you \nknow. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, \nand instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I \ndon\u2019t think it was an accident he let me find out how the Mirror \nworked. It\u2019s almost like he thought I had the right to face \nVoldemort if I could ...\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yeah, Dumbledore\u2019s barking, all right,\u2019 said Ron proudly. \n\u2018Listen, you\u2019ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow. \nThe points are all in and Slytherin won, of course \u2013 you missed the \nlast Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw \nwithout you \u2013 but the food\u2019ll be good.\u2019 \n\nAt that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over. \n\u2018You\u2019ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,\u2019 she said firmly. \n\n* \nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal. \n\n\u2018I want to go to the feast,\u2019 he told Madam Pomfrey as she \nstraightened his many sweet-boxes. \u2018I can, can\u2019t I?\u2019 \n\n\u2018Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,\u2019 she \nsaid sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn\u2019t \nrealise how risky feasts could be. \u2018And you have another visitor.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh good,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Who is it?\u2019 \nHagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he \n\nwas indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down \nnext to Harry, took one look at him and burst into tears. \n\n\u2018It\u2019s \u2013 all \u2013 my \u2013 ruddy \u2013 fault!\u2019 he sobbed, his face in his hands. \n\u2018I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was the \nonly thing he didn\u2019t know an\u2019 I told him! Yeh could\u2019ve died! All \nfer a dragon egg! I\u2019ll never drink again! I should be chucked out \nan\u2019 made ter live as a Muggle!\u2019 \n\n\u2018Hagrid!\u2019 said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief \nand remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. \u2018Hagrid, he\u2019d \nhave found out somehow, this is Voldemort we\u2019re talking about, \nhe\u2019d have found out even if you hadn\u2019t told him.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Yeh could\u2019ve died!\u2019 sobbed Hagrid. \u2018An\u2019 don\u2019 say the name!\u2019 \n\u2018VOLDEMORT!\u2019 Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, \n\n\n\n220 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\nhe stopped crying. \u2018I\u2019ve met him and I\u2019m calling him by his name. \nPlease cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it\u2019s gone, he can\u2019t use \nit. Have a Chocolate Frog, I\u2019ve got loads ...\u2019 \n\nHagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, \u2018That \nreminds me. I\u2019ve got yeh a present.\u2019 \n\n\u2018It\u2019s not a stoat sandwich, is it?\u2019 said Harry anxiously and at last \nHagrid gave a weak chuckle. \n\n\u2018Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it. \n\u2019Course, he shoulda sacked me instead \u2013 anyway, got yeh this ...\u2019 \n\nIt seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry \nopened it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling \nand waving at him from every page were his mother and father. \n\n\u2018Sent owls off ter all yer parents\u2019 old school friends, askin\u2019 fer \nphotos ... Knew yeh didn\u2019 have any ... D\u2019yeh like it?\u2019 \n\nHarry couldn\u2019t speak, but Hagrid understood. \n* \n\nHarry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that \nnight. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey\u2019s fussing-about, \ninsisting on giving him one last check-up, so the Great Hall was \nalready full. It was decked out in the Slytherin colours of green \nand silver to celebrate Slytherin\u2019s winning the House Cup for the \nseventh year in a row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin \nserpent covered the wall behind the High Table. \n\nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush and then \neverybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat \nbetween Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to \nignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \n\nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble \ndied away. \n\n\u2018Another year gone!\u2019 Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u2018And I must \ntrouble you with an old man\u2019s wheezing waffle before we sink our \nteeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully \nyour heads are all a little fuller than they were ... you have the \nwhole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year \nstarts ... \n\n\u2018Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding \nand the points stand thus: in fourth place, Gryffindor, with three \nhundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hun-\ndred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw have four hundred and twenty-six \nand Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.\u2019 \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 221 \n \n\n \n\nA storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin \ntable. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the \ntable. It was a sickening sight. \n\n\u2018Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018However, \nrecent events must be taken into account.\u2019 \n\nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little. \n\u2018Ahem,\u2019 said Dumbledore. \u2018I have a few last-minute points to \n\ndish out. Let me see. Yes ... \n\u2018First \u2013 to Mr Ronald Weasley ...\u2019 \nRon went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with bad \n\nsunburn. \n\u2018... for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in \n\nmany years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u2019 \nGryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars \n\noverhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other \nPrefects, \u2018My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past \nMcGonagall\u2019s giant chess set!\u2019 \n\nAt last there was silence again. \n\u2018Second \u2013 to Miss Hermione Granger ... for the use of cool logic \n\nin the face of fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.\u2019 \nHermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected \n\nshe had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were \nbeside themselves \u2013 they were a hundred points up. \n\n\u2018Third \u2013 to Mr Harry Potter ...\u2019 said Dumbledore. The room \nwent deadly quiet. \u2018... for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I \naward Gryffindor house sixty points.\u2019 \n\nThe din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling \nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred \nand seventy-two points \u2013 exactly the same as Slytherin. They had \ndrawn for the House Cup \u2013 if only Dumbledore had given Harry \njust one more point. \n\nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \n\u2018There are all kinds of courage,\u2019 said Dumbledore, smiling. \u2018It \n\ntakes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just \nas much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to \nMr Neville Longbottom.\u2019 \n\nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have \nthought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the \nnoise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron and \nHermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, \n\n\n\n222 HARRY  POTTER \n \n\n \n\ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never \nwon so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheer-\ning, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn\u2019t \nhave looked more stunned and horrified if he\u2019d just had the \nBody-Bind curse put on him. \n\n\u2018Which means,\u2019 Dumbledore called over the storm of applause, \nfor even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall \nof Slytherin, \u2018we need a little change of decoration.\u2019 \n\nHe clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became \nscarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent van-\nished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was \nshaking Professor McGonagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible forced \nsmile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s \nfeelings towards him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry \nHarry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next \nyear, or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. \n\nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019s life, better than winning at \nQuidditch or Christmas or knocking out mountain trolls ... he \nwould never, ever forget tonight. \n\n* \nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to \ncome, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron \npassed with good marks; Hermione, of course, came top of the \nyear. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark \nmaking up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that \nGoyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be \nthrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron \nsaid, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life. \n\nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were \npacked, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets; \nnotes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use \nmagic over the holidays (\u2018I always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us \nthese,\u2019 said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them \ndown to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were \nboarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the country-\nside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott\u2019s Every-Flavour \nBeans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard \nrobes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine \nand three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross Station. \n\nIt took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A \n\n\n\n THE  MAN  WITH  TWO  FACES 223 \n \n\n \n\nwizened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go \nthrough the gate in twos and threes so they didn\u2019t attract attention \nby all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the Muggles. \n\n\u2018You must come and stay this summer,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018both of you \u2013 \nI\u2019ll send you an owl.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Thanks,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018I\u2019ll need something to look forward to.\u2019 \nPeople jostled them as they moved forwards towards the gate-\n\nway back to the Muggle world. Some of them called: \n\u2018Bye, Harry!\u2019 \n\u2018See you, Potter!\u2019 \n\u2018Still famous,\u2019 said Ron, grinning at him. \n\u2018Not where I\u2019m going, I promise you,\u2019 said Harry. \nHe, Ron and Hermione passed through the gateway together. \n\u2018There he is, Mum, there he is, look!\u2019 \nIt was Ginny Weasley, Ron\u2019s younger sister, but she wasn\u2019t \n\npointing at Ron. \n\u2018Harry Potter!\u2019 she squealed. \u2018Look, Mum! I can see \u2013\u2019 \n\u2018Be quiet, Ginny, and it\u2019s rude to point.\u2019 \nMrs Weasley smiled down at them. \n\u2018Busy year?\u2019 she said. \n\u2018Very,\u2019 said Harry. \u2018Thanks for the fudge and the jumper, Mrs \n\nWeasley.\u2019 \n\u2018Oh, it was nothing, dear.\u2019 \n\u2018Ready, are you?\u2019 \nIt was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still moustached, still \n\nlooking furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying an owl in a cage in a \nstation full of ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and \nDudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry. \n\n\u2018You must be Harry\u2019s family!\u2019 said Mrs Weasley. \n\u2018In a manner of speaking,\u2019 said Uncle Vernon. \u2018Hurry up, boy, \n\nwe haven\u2019t got all day.\u2019 He walked away. \nHarry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione. \n\u2018See you over the summer, then.\u2019 \n\u2018Hope you have \u2013 er \u2013 a good holiday,\u2019 said Hermione, looking \n\nuncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so \nunpleasant. \n\n\u2018Oh, I will,\u2019 said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that \nwas spreading over his face. \u2018They don\u2019t know we\u2019re not allowed to \nuse magic at home. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this \nsummer ...\u2019 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\nJ. K. (JOANNE KATHLEEN) ROWLING  \nhas written fiction since she was a child. \nBorn in 1965, she grew up in Chepstow  \nand wrote her first \u2018book\u2019 at the age of six  \n- a story about a rabbit called Rabbit. \nShe studied French and Classics at Exeter  \nUniversity, then moved to London to  \nwork at Amnesty International, and then  \nto Portugal to teach English as a foreign  \nlanguage, before settling in Edinburgh. \n \nThe idea for Harry Potter occurred to her  \non the train from Manchester to London,  \nwhere she says Harry Potter \u2018just strolled  \ninto my head fully formed\u2019, and by the  \ntime she had arrived at King\u2019s Cross,  \nmany of the characters had taken shape. \nDuring the next five years she outlined  \nthe plots for each book and began writing  \nthe first in the series, Harry Potter and  \nthe Philosopher\u2019s Stone, which was first  \npublished by Bloomsbury in 1997.
